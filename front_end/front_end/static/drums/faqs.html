<h4>Recent Update</h4>



<H5>2010-1-10</H5>

<p>We have integrated Reference Sequence database from NCBI(<a

	href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/</a>)

into DRUMS. Point mutation sites in DRUMS have been analyzed, possible

reference sequence and mutation site has been shown in DRUMS gene

information page.</p>



<p>We used Gene ID which HGNC provided and a mapping

file (gene2refseq.gz) which NCBI provided to find the possible reference

sequences.</p>



<H5>2010-12-13</H5>

<p>We have updated our database of HGNC gene table and some of the

mutation data. Total number of mutation and gene records could be found

<a href="./status.jsp">here</a>.</p>



<p>Upload function has been modified. cDNA mutation information was

chosen to be the main factor of one record which should not be left

blank.</p>



<H5>2010-11-15</H5>

<p>New function of navigation searching has been added in the index

page of DRUMS.</p>

<p>0 searching result bug has been fixed.</p>



<H5>2010-10-18</H5>

<p>Mutation data from <a

	href="http://www.retina-international.org/sci-news/">http://www.retina-international.org/sci-news/</a>

has been added to DRUMS. Pubmed information were adjusted by us

manually. Totally 1746 mutation records were added.</p>



<H5>2010-09-15</H5>

<p>Searching method of DRUMS was improved. "Chrome" field was set to

be strict length matching.</p>



<H5>2010-08-20</H5>

<p>Gene information from HGNC was updated.</p>



<H5>2010-07-15</H5>

<p>First demo of DRUMS.</p>

<h4>What is Drums?</h4>

<p>The full name of DRUMS is "Disease Related Unique Mutation Search

Engine". Drums is a 'Bio-Google' in Mutation, Gene, Phenotype, LSDB

Field. It was developed by 'BMInfo Group' from Tongji University and

SCBIT in 2009.</p>

<a class="anchor" name="#whataim"></a>

<h4>What are the aims of Drums?</h4>

<p>The overall purpose of Drum is collecting mutation records from

the world's LSDBs and providing a proper search engine for checking

whether a mutation record has been published or not. This aim is pursued

by the following steps:</p>

<ul>

	<li>Use HGNC gene as standard of gene symbol.</li>

	<li>Collect LSDB URLs as many as possible.</li>

	<li>Different python scripts were written to extract mutation

	records automatically from LSDB.</li>

	<li>Check the mutation information mannually, recorded in HGVS

	standard format.</li>

	<li>Store all the data in Mysql database, create appropriate

	search method.</li>

	<li>Establish Web-based interface to serve.</li>
