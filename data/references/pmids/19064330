A novel molecular aspect of Japanese patients with medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD): c.449-452delCTGA is a common mutation in Japanese patients with MCADD.
We studied 11 Japanese patients with medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) and found a common mutation, c.449-452delCTGA, which accounted for 45% of the mutations. Seven of 10 independent patients carried at least one copy of this mutation. Phenotypes of homozygous patients with the c.449-452delCTGA mutation varied from asymptomatic to life-threatening metabolic decompensation in Japanese patients with MCADD, similar to the phenotypic variations in Caucasians. This study suggests the genotypic difference between those of Caucasians and Japanese regarding MCADD.
