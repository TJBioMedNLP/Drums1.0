Hb Nottingham (alpha2beta2 (FG5) 98 val leads to gly) in a Caucasian male: clinical and biosynthetic studies.
A second instance of the unstable mutant Hb Nottingham (alpha2beta2 (FG5) 98 Val leads to Gly) is reported in a 7-year-old boy. Because of splenomegaly, cholelithiasis, and frequent episodes of abdominal pain, he underwent a splenectomy and cholecystectomy at age 6. The surgery resulted in both an amelioration of his RBC destruction and an acceleration of his rate of growth.
