Novel point mutation (W184R) in neonatal type 2 Gaucher disease.
Gaucher disease is the most prevalent inherited sphingolipidosis and results from deficient glucocerebrosidase activity. Three clinical forms of Gaucher disease have been described: type 1, or non-neuronopathic; type 2, or acute neuronopathic; and type 3, or subacute neuronopathic. We have identified a novel mutation in a patient of Russian-British descent who died of type 2 Gaucher disease a few hours after birth. A heterozygous T --> C transition mutation in exon 6, cDNA nucleotide position 667, results in the substitution of tryptophan by arginine at amino acid residue 184 (W184R) of glucocerebrosidase. This mutation creates a new cleavage site for the restriction endonuclease Hinf1. We developed a method that utilizes Hinf1 restriction endonuclease analysis to confirm the presence of the mutation and test family members. The second mutation identified in the other glucocerebrosidase allele of the patient is mutation L444P, a severe mutation frequent in type 2 and 3 Gaucher disease. Since the patient died very shortly after birth, we postulate that the W184R/L444P genotype may result in little or no detectable glucocerebrosidase activity and thus a poor prognosis.
