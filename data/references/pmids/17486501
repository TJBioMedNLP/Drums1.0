Hematological and molecular characteristics of Hb Sarrebourg [beta131(H9)Gln-->Arg (CAG-->CGG)] found in a Spanish family.
We report the hematological and molecular characteristics of Hb Sarrebourg [beta131(H9)Gln-->Arg (CAG-->CGG)] found in nine members of a Spanish family. All the carriers were heterozygous for the variant and hematologically normal. Up to now this hemoglobin (Hb) variant has only been reported once before, in a boy of Turkish origin.
