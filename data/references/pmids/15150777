Large deletion of the GJB6 gene in deaf patients heterozygous for the GJB2 gene mutation: genotypic and phenotypic analysis.
Recent investigations identified a large deletion of the GJB6 gene in trans to a mutation of GJB2 in deaf patients. We looked for GJB2 mutations and GJB6 deletions in 255 French patients presenting with a phenotype compatible with DFNB1. 32% of the patients had biallelic GJB2 mutations and 6% were a heterozygous for a GJB2 mutation and a GJB6 deletion. Biallelic GJB2 mutations and combined GJB2/GJB6 anomalies were more frequent in profoundly deaf children. Based on these results, we are now assessing GJB6 deletion status in cases of prelingual hearing loss.
