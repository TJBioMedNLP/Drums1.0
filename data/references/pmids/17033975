Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy associated with mutations in the desmosomal gene desmocollin-2.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is an inherited myocardial disorder associated with arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden death. To date, mutations in four genes encoding major desmosomal proteins (plakoglobin, desmoplakin, plakophilin-2, and desmoglein-2) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ARVD/C. We screened 77 probands with ARVD/C for mutations in desmocollin-2 (DSC2), a gene coding for a desmosomal cadherin. Two heterozygous mutations--a deletion and an insertion--were identified in four probands. Both mutations result in frameshifts and premature truncation of the desmocollin-2 protein. For the first time, we have identified mutations in desmocollin-2 in patients with ARVD/C, a finding that is consistent with the hypothesis that ARVD/C is a disease of the desmosome.
