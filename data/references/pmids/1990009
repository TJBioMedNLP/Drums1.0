The effects of different cysteine for glycine substitutions within alpha 2(I) chains. Evidence of distinct structural domains within the type I collagen triple helix.
Affected individuals from two apparently distinct, mild osteogenesis imperfecta families were heterozygous for a G to T transition in the COL1A2 gene that resulted in cysteine for glycine substitutions at position 646 in the alpha 2(I) chain of type I collagen. A child with a moderately severe form of osteogenesis imperfecta was heterozygous for a G to T transition that resulted in a substitution of cysteine for glycine at position 259 in the COL1A2 gene. Type I collagen molecules containing an alpha 2(I) chain with cysteine at position 259 denaturated at a lower temperature than molecules containing an alpha 2(I) chain with cysteine at position 646. In contrast to cysteine for glycine substitutions in the alpha 1(I) chain, the severity of the osteogenesis imperfecta phenotype is not directly proportional to the distance of the mutation from the amino-terminal end of the triple helix. These findings could be explained if the type I collagen triple helix contains discontinuous domains that differ in their contributions to maintaining helix stability.
