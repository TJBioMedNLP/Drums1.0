T-cell-depleted maternal bone marrow transplantation for siblings with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency.
Prenatal diagnosis of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency in a male fetus made possible elective neonatal bone marrow transplantation before onset of symptoms. Bone marrow transplantation was performed by using T-cell-depleted maternal marrow that had been cryopreserved 2 years earlier, at the time that his older affected brother underwent transplantation. The second patient had less morbidity and more rapid reconstitution of his immune function.
