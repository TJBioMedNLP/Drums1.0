Hb J-Antakya or alpha 2 beta (2)65(E9)Lys----Met in a Turkish family and Hb complutense or alpha 2 beta (2)127(H5)Gln----Glu in a Spanish family; correction of a previously published identification.
Almost 10 years ago we reported in this journal the characterization of Hb Hacettepe or alpha 2 beta (2)127(H5)Gln----Glu. Unfortunately, we have to conclude that the original characterization of this Turkish variant was in error. The corrected data are presented in this short communication. The variant (alpha 2 beta (2)65(E9)Lys----Met) was (re)named Hb J-Antakya, after the city where the family resides. An abnormal Hb, observed in a Spanish family and named Hb Complutense, had the beta 127 Gln----Glu substitution, erroneously assigned to the Turkish variant.
