Single base mutation in the pro alpha 2(I) collagen gene that causes efficient splicing of RNA from exon 27 to exon 29 and synthesis of a shortened but in-frame pro alpha 2(I) chain.
Previous observations demonstrated that a lethal variant of osteogenesis imperfecta had two altered alleles for pro alpha 2(I) chains of type I procollagen. One mutation produced a nonfunctioning allele in that there was synthesis of mRNA but no detectable synthesis of pro alpha 2(I) chains from the allele. The mutation in the other allele caused synthesis of shortened pro alpha 2(I) chains that lacked most or all of the 18 amino acids encoded by exon 28. Subclones of the pro alpha 2(I) gene were prepared from the proband's DNA and the DNA sequence was determined for a 582-base-pair (bp) region that extended from the last 30 bp of intervening sequence 26 to the first 26 bp of intervening sequence 29. Data from six independent subclones demonstrated that all had the same sequence as a previously isolated normal clone for the pro alpha 2(I) gene except that four subclones had a single base mutation at the 3' end of intervening sequence 27. The mutation was a substitution of guanine for adenine that changed the universal consensus sequence for the 3' splicing site of RNA from -AG- to -GG-. S1 nuclease experiments demonstrated that about half the pro alpha 2(I) mRNA in the proband's fibroblasts was abnormally spliced and that the major species of abnormal pro alpha 2(I) mRNA was completely spliced from the last codon of exon 27 to the first codon of exon 29. The mutation is apparently unique among RNA splicing mutations of mammalian systems in producing a shortened polypeptide chain that is in-frame in terms of coding sequences, that is used in the subunit assembly of a protein, and that contributes to a lethal phenotype.
