Hb Doha or alpha 2 beta 2[X-N-Met-1(NA1)Val----Glu]; a new beta-chain abnormal hemoglobin observed in a Qatari female.
Structural analysis of a fast-moving hemoglobin variant, present in three members of a Qatari family, identified a Val----Glu substitution at position 1 (NA1) of the beta-chain. The introduction of this glutamic acid residue prevents the removal of the initiator methionine, thus extending the N-terminus by one residue to Met-Glu-His-Leu-Thr-. The methionine residue is blocked by an as yet not completely identified molecule. The presence of the variant in a heterozygote does not have clinical consequences.
