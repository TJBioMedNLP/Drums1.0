Some properties of hemoglobin Gun Hill.
Hb Gun Hill has been found in an asymptomatic black female living in Alabama; neither her parents nor her two siblings carry the variant. The deletion of five amino acid residues in the beta chain of Hb Gun Hill (alpha2beta2 91-95 deleted) causes this variant to have a high oxygen affinity, an interaction coefficient of unity and an absence of the Bohr effect. The rate of oxidation of liganded Hb Gun Hill by the ferricyanide ion follows first-order kinetics. Hb Gun Hill is to a great extent dissociated into dimers over a wide range of pH values.
