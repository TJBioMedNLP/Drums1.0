Beta-thalassemia due to a T----A mutation within the ATA box.
Sequence analyses of amplified DNA from a Yugoslavian patient with Hb Lepore-beta-thalassemia and from his father with a simple beta-thalassemia trait have revealed a T----A mutation within the ATA box at a position 30 base pairs upstream from the Cap site. The nucleotide substitution was confirmed through dot-blot analysis of amplified DNA with specific 32P-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide probes. The patient had a clinically severe condition; his Hb Lepore-beta-thalassemia was of the beta + type, as about 8-10% of the non-alpha chain was normal beta A. The same T----A mutation at nucleotide -30 was present on both chromosomes of a young Turkish patient who suffered from a thalassemia intermedia with a low level of Hb F (13.1%) and a relatively high beta A chain synthesis. These data are similar to those obtained for other types of beta +-thalassemia caused by comparable substitutions at positions 31, 29, and 28 base pairs upstream from the Cap site of the beta-globin gene.
