Hb Tsukumi [beta117(G19)His-->Tyr]: a new hemoglobin variant found in a Japanese male.
We accidentally observed an abnormal elution pattern on high performance liquid chromatogram when we examined the Hb A1c level in a 65-year-old male patient who suffered from pneumoconiosis and alcoholic liver injury. The value of the glycated fraction was within the normal range but the elution patterns on high performance liquid chromatography varied with the glycohemoglobin analyzers. Isoelectrofocusing and urea-cellulose column chromatography showed an anomalous fast-moving beta chain estimated at approximately 47%. The instability test of the hemolysate was slightly positive. Structural analysis demonstrated that the mutant was consisted by a substitution of His-Tyr at beta117. This new variant was named Hb Tsukumi for the place of residence of the patient. Additionally, the nucleotide sequence showed a change of C-->T [CAC (His)-->TAC (Tyr)] at the first base in the 117th codon of the beta gene.
