Phenotypic analyses and mutation screening of the SLC26A4 and FOXI1 genes in 101 Taiwanese families with bilateral nonsyndromic enlarged vestibular aqueduct (DFNB4) or Pendred syndrome.
Recessive mutations in the SLC26A4 gene are responsible for nonsyndromic enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) and Pendred syndrome. However, in some affected families, only 1 or 0 mutated allele can be identified, as well as no clear correlation between SLC26A4 genotypes and clinical phenotypes, hampering the accuracy of genetic counseling. To elucidate the genetic composition of nonsyndromic EVA and Pendred syndrome, we screened related genomic fragments, including the SLC26A4 coding regions, the SLC26A4 promoter and the FOXI1 transcription factor gene, in 101 Taiwanese families, and analyzed their phenotypic and genotypic results. Mutation screening in the SLC26A4 coding regions by direct sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction detected 2 mutations in 63 (62%) families, 1 mutation in 24 (24%) families and no mutation in 14 (14%) families. The radiological findings, the presence of goiters and the audiological results were not different among probands (i.e. index cases of the families) with different SLC26A4 genotypes. Specifically, probands heterozygous for SLC26A4 mutations demonstrated clinical features indistinguishable from those of probands with 2 mutated alleles, implicating that there might be undetected mutations. However, except for a variant (c.-2554G>A of SLC26A4) with possible pathological consequences, no definite mutation was detected after extensive screening in the SLC26A4 promoter and FOXI1. In other words, in most Taiwanese families nonsyndromic EVA or Pendred syndrome might not result from aberrance in the transcriptional control of SLC26A4 by FOXI1. Meanwhile, exploration of undetected mutations in the SLC26A4 noncoding regions revealed 9 divergent haplotypes among the 21 no-mutation-detected SLC26A4 alleles of the c.919-2A>G heterozygotes, indicating that there might be no common and predominant mutations in the SLC26A4 introns.
