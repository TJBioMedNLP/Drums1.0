Defective C-propeptides of the proalpha2(I) chain of type I procollagen impede molecular assembly and result in osteogenesis imperfecta.
Type I procollagen is a heterotrimer composed of two proalpha1(I) chains and one proalpha2(I) chain, encoded by the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, respectively. Mutations in these genes usually lead to dominantly inherited forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) by altering the triple helical domains, but a few affect sequences in the proalpha1(I) C-terminal propeptide (C-propeptide), and one, which has a phenotype only in homozygotes, alters the proalpha2(I) C-propeptide. Here we describe four dominant mutations in the COL1A2 gene that alter sequences of the proalpha2(I) C-propeptide in individuals with clinical features of a milder form of the disease, OI type IV. Three of the four appear to interfere with disulfide bonds that stabilize the C-propeptide conformation and its interaction with other chains in the trimer. Cultured cells synthesized proalpha2(I) chains that were slow to assemble with proalpha1(I) chains to form heterotrimers and that were retained intracellularly. Some alterations led to the uncharacteristic formation of proalpha1(I) homotrimers. These findings show that the C-propeptide of proalpha2(I), like that of the proalpha1(I) C-propeptide, is essential for efficient assembly of type I procollagen heterotrimers. The milder OI phenotypes likely reflect a diminished amount of normal type I procollagen, small populations of overmodified heterotrimers, and proalpha1(I) homotrimers that are compatible with normal skeletal growth.
