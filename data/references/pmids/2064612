Characterization of a type I collagen alpha 2(I) glycine-586 to valine substitution in osteogenesis imperfecta type IV. Detection of the mutation and prenatal diagnosis by a chemical cleavage method.
A chemical cleavage method for detecting mismatched bases in heteroduplexes formed between patient mRNA and control cDNA probes was employed to identify a single base mutation in a heterozygous case of osteogenesis imperfecta type IV. The parents' fibroblast mRNA did not contain the mutation. The region of the mRNA mismatch was amplified by using the polymerase chain reaction, cloned and sequenced. A point mutation of G to U at base-pair 2162 of the collagen alpha 2(I) mRNA resulted in the substitution of glycine by valine at amino acid position 586 of the helix. This substitution disrupted the critical Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeating unit of the collagen triple helix and resulted in helix destabilization, as evidenced by a decreased thermal stability. This local disturbance to helix propagation from the C-terminus to the N-terminus led to the overmodification of the collagen helix downstream towards the N-terminus. However, collagen secretion in vitro was normal, and the clinical phenotype probably resulted from the secretion into the extracellular matrix of the mutant collagen combined with a decrease in collagen production to 65% of control values. The rapid detection of the osteogenesis imperfecta mutation by using the chemical cleavage method afforded the opportunity to apply the technique to prenatal diagnosis in the next pregnancy of the mother of the osteogenesis imperfecta patient. The absence of a mismatched base in chorionic villus mRNA and control cDNA heteroduplexes indicated that the foetus did not carry the mutation, which was confirmed by the subsequent delivery of a normal baby.
