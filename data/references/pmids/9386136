KVLQT1 C-terminal missense mutation causes a forme fruste long-QT syndrome.
BACKGROUND: KVLQT1, the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of a cardiac potassium channel, is the most common cause of the dominant form of long-QT syndrome (LQT1-type), the Romano-Ward syndrome (RWS). The overall phenotype of RWS is characterized by a prolonged QT interval on the ECG and cardiac ventricular arrhythmias leading to recurrent syncopes and sudden death. However, there is considerable variability in the clinical presentation, and potential severity is often difficult to evaluate. To analyze the relationship between phenotypes and underlying defects in KVLQT1, we investigated mutations in this gene in 20 RWS families originating from France. METHODS AND RESULTS: By PCR-SSCP analysis, 16 missense mutations were identified in KVLQT1, 11 of them being novel. Fifteen mutations, localized in the transmembrane domains S2-S3, S4-S5, P, and S6, were associated with a high percentage of symptomatic carriers (55 of 95, or 58%) and sudden deaths (23 of 95, or 24%). In contrast, a missense mutation, Arg555Cys, identified in the C-terminal domain in 3 families, was associated with a significantly less pronounced QT prolongation (459+/-33 ms, n=41, versus 480+/-32 ms, n=70, P=.0012), and significantly lower percentages of symptomatic carriers (7 of 44, or 16%, P<.001) and sudden deaths (2 of 44, or 5%, P<.01). Most of the cardiac events occurring in these 3 families were triggered by drugs known to affect ventricular repolarization. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a wide KVLQT1 allelic heterogeneity among 20 families in which KVLQT1 causes RWS. We describe the first missense mutation in the C-terminal domain of KVLQT1, which is clearly associated with a fruste phenotype, which could be a favoring factor of acquired LQT syndrome.
