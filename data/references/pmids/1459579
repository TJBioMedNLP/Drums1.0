Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants in Hawaii.
Sequence analysis has been performed on the DNA of 13 glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient males from Hawaii, 6 of Filipino, 6 of Laotian, and 1 of Chinese extraction. Four different mutations were found: A-->T at cDNA nt 835, G-->A at nt 871, C-->T at nt 1360, and G-->A at nt 1388. The mutations at nt 835 and nt 1360 have not been described previously, and the latter, in particular, appears to be relatively common. The nt 1360 mutation changes the same codon as is altered in a previously described mutation, G6PD Andalus.
