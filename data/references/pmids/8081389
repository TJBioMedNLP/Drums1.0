Further evidence that the failure to cleave the aminopropeptide of type I procollagen is the cause of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VII.
Dermal fibroblasts from a Chinese Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VII patient synthesized approximately equal amounts of normal pro-alpha 2(I) chains of type I procollagen and abnormal ones with electrophoretic mobility of pN alpha 2(I) chains, in which the amino-propeptide (N-propeptide) was retained. Reverse-transcriptase PCR analysis of the proband's RNA showed outsplicing of the 54 base exon 6 in half of the pro-alpha 2(I) mRNAs. Exon 6 encodes 18 amino acids of the N-telopeptide which contains the procollagen N-proteinase cleavage site and a cross-link precursor lysine. Loss of these sequences would result in failure to cleave the amino-propeptide of pro-alpha 2(I) and the accumulation of pN-alpha 2(I) chains. Nucleotide sequencing analyses of the proband's COL1A2 gene showed the presence of a T to C transition at position +2 of intron 6 in one allele and the proband is heterozygous for the defect. This mutation which destroyed the consensus GT dinucleotide at the 5' splice donor site of the intron is responsible for the loss of exon 6 by exon skipping. Electron microscopic analysis of the patient's dermis showed the presence of abnormal collagen I fibrils of irregular diameter and circularity. This mutation in COL1A2 in an EDS VII patient is the first reported case in the Chinese population and is identical to one reported for another EDS-VII (Libyan) patient. The occurrence of an identical mutation in two probands of different ethnic origin is direct evidence that the mutant genotype is the cause of the EDS VII phenotype.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
