GJB2 mutation spectrum in 209 hearing impaired individuals of predominantly Caribbean Hispanic and African descent.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study is to determine whether Caribbean Hispanic and African admixture populations have a paucity of mutations in GJB2, encoding connexin 26. METHODS: We reported the paucity of mutations in GJB2 and deletions in GJB6 in Caribbean Hispanic and African admixture populations in the Bronx, NY, in 2007 [1]. We have now collected 102 additional probands with non-syndromic sensorineural hearing impairment (NSHI), for a total of 209. We describe here a presentation of the combined data. RESULTS: Of the 209 probands, 36% have affected family members with NSHI and the rest have sporadic occurrence. Of the familial cases, 43% had a first-degree relative affected, and the remainder a more distant relative. The hearing impairment ranged from unilateral mild to bilateral profound, with 76% exhibiting bilateral NSHI (BLNSHI). The single coding exon of the GJB2 gene was sequenced in 209 probands, PCR screening for del(GJB6-D13S1830) and sequencing of the non-coding exon of GJB2 to look for the known splice site mutation was performed in 32 NSHI patients with a heterozygous variation in GJB2, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) testing of GJB2 and GJB6 exon deletions or amplifications (P163 GJB-WFS1 kit) was done in 70 probands. Eight unrelated individuals had biallelic GJB2 mutations, representing 4% of our entire cohort, or 5% of our probands with BLNSHI. Of 127 probands of Hispanic or African descent with BLNSHI, six (4.7%) had biallelic pathogenic mutations, three (2.3%) had monoallelic mutations and 118 (93%) had no disease-causing mutations in GJB2. At the same time, no major deletions were identified either by PCR screening (del(GJB6-D13S1830)) or by MLPA analysis (GJB2 or GJB6), and no subjects had the known splice site mutation in GJB2. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that GJB2 is not the major contributor to the genetic basis of NSHI for the Bronx minority admixture populations.
