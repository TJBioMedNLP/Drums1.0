Molecular analysis of eight biochemically unique glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants found in Japan.
We analyzed the molecular mutations of eight known Japanese glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) variants with unique biochemical properties. Three of them were caused by novel missense mutations: G6PD Musashino by 185 C-->T, G6PD Asahikawa by 695 G-->A, and G6PD Kamiube by 1387 C-->T. Predicted amino acid substitutions causing asymptomatic variants G6PD Musashino (62 Pro-->Phe) and G6PD Kamiube (463 Arg-->Cys) were located in regions near the amino or carboxyl end of the polypeptide chain, whereas an amino acid change 232 Cys-->Tyr causing a class 1 variant G6PD Asahikawa was located in the region where amino acid alterations in some class 1 variants were clustered. The other five variants had known missense mutations, namely, G6PD Fukushima, 1246 G-->A, G6PD Morioka, 1339 G-->A, and G6PD Iwate, G6PD Niigata and G6PD Yamaguchi, 1160 G-->A, which cause variants, G6PD Tokyo, G6PD Santiago de Cuba, and G6PD Beverly Hills, respectively.
