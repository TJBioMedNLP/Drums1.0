Identification of a single base change in a new human mutant glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase gene by polymerase-chain-reaction amplification of the entire coding region from genomic DNA.
We report the characterization at the molecular level of a mutant glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene in a Greek boy who presented with a chronic non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia. In order to identify the mutation from a small amount of patient material, we adopted an approach which by-passes the need to construct a library by using the polymerase chain reaction. The entire coding region was amplified in eight sections, with genomic DNA as template. The DNA fragments were then cloned in an M13 vector and sequenced. The only difference from the sequence of normal G6PD was a T----G substitution at nucleotide position 648 in exon 7, which predicts a substitution of leucine for phenylalanine at amino acid position 216. This mutation creates a new recognition site for the restriction nuclease BalI. We confirmed the presence of the mutation in the DNA of the patient's mother, who was found to be heterozygous for the new BalI site. This is the first transversion among the point mutations thus far reported in the human G6PD gene.
