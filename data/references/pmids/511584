Hemoglobin Riyadh-beta 0-thalassemia in an Indian family.
An Indian (Asian) patient with compound heterozygosity for Hb Riyadh and beta 0-thalassemia is described. Hb Riyadh forms about 95% of the hemoglobin present. The clinico-pathological picture is identical to that of simple beta-thalassemia trait confirming the harmless nature of the substitution beta 120(GH3) Lys leads to Asn.
