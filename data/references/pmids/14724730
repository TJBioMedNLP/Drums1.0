Wolfram syndrome: phenotype and novel mutation in two Taiwanese siblings.
Wolfram syndrome (WS) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder. The responsible gene, WFS1, was identified in 1998 and over 66 mutations have been reported since then. We report 2 siblings in a Taiwanese family with WS. They had similar clinical courses, including successive development of diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, diabetes insipidus, hearing impairment, and urological complications from age 5 to 15 years. Rapid progression of systemic and neurological symptoms was noted in the elder brother. Mutation analysis of the 2 probands revealed compound heterozygotes of 1 novel and 1 previously reported mutation. Their parents and an asymptomatic sibling were carriers of 1 mutation.
