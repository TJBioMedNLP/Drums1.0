Hemoglobin Agenogi [beta 90 (F6) Glu-->Lys] found in Piedmont. Case report.
An electrophoretically slow-moving hemoglobin, with abnormal beta chains, has been found in a young woman and in three members of her family. This variant amounted to 41% of the total Hb, and did not cause important clinical manifestations, although characterized by decreased oxygen affinity. Structural and aminoacid analyses revealed the mutation of Hb-Agenogi: 90 (F6) Glu-->Lys, a rare variant so far detected in unrelated racial and ethnic groups. This is the first affected family of ascertained Piedmontese ancestry.
