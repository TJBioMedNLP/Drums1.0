A novel beta thalassemia gene with a single base mutation in the conserved polypyrimidine sequence at the 3' end of IVS 2.
An adult Algerian patient with homozygous beta thalassemia was found to have a unique beta thalassemia gene. Cloning and sequencing revealed that the only abnormality present in this beta gene is a transversion in the polypyrimidine stretch at the 3' end of the large intervening sequence (IVS 2) six bases 5' to the consensus AG dinucleotide sequence (CCGCCCACAG instead of CCTCCCACAG). In addition, digestion of the cloned fragment by the enzyme Mnl I demonstrates the disappearance of a restriction site as expected. This is the first example of a defect in the consensus sequence at the 3' end of an IVS leading to a thalassemia phenotype presumably due to decreased splicing.
