X-linked recessive chondrodysplasia punctata due to a new point mutation of the ARSE gene.
Chondrodysplasia punctata (CP) is a heterogeneous group of bone dysplasias that are characterized by abnormal calcium deposition in areas of enchondral bone formation. The existence of an X-linked recessive form of chondrodysplasia punctata (CDPX) has been recognized in patients who are nullisomic for the Xp22.3 region, presenting with complex phenotypes. The gene of CDPX has been identified recently, and five point mutations of the gene, named ARSE, have been described. Here, we report on the clinical and molecular characterization of a patient with CDPX. The patient presented at birth with cranial and facial anomalies and short stature; an x-ray skeletal survey showed punctate calcifications and striking hand and foot abnormalities. Single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and sequence analysis of the patient's DNA allowed the identification of a new mutation of the ARSE gene; this mutation causes an amino acid substitution from cysteine to tyrosine at position 492 of the ARSE predicted protein product. The clinical description of patients with CDPX due to known mutation of the ARSE is of interest for the precise delineation of the clinical spectrum of the disease.
