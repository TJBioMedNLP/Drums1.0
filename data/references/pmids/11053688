Frequent mutations in Japanese patients with acid maltase deficiency.
We screened 22 Japanese patients with acid maltase deficiency (seven with the infantile type, eight with the juvenile type and seven with the adult type) for three previously described mutations, D645E, S529V and R672Q, and a novel mutation, R600C. Although D645E has been reported to be common in Chinese patients with the infantile type, only three of 44 alleles (two of 14 infantile type alleles) from Japanese patients harbored the D645E mutation. The S529V mutation was identified in six of 14 alleles from adult-onset patients. None of the infantile or juvenile patients harbored the S529V mutation. Therefore, S529V apparently results in the adult type disease and is common in Japanese adult-onset patients. R672Q was identified in two pairs of siblings with the juvenile type. A novel mutation, R600C, was identified in eight of 22 patients (nine of 44 alleles). Therefore, R600C is another common Japanese mutation occurring at a CpG dinucleotide "hot spot". Homozygosity for this mutation apparently results in the infantile phenotype. Genetic diagnosis by detecting these four mutations might be feasible for most Japanese patients with acid maltase deficiency.
