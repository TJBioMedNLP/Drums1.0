A greater than 200 kb deletion removing the entire beta-like globin gene cluster in a family of Irish descent.
We describe a new deletional form of gamma delta beta-thalassemia segregating in two generations of a family of Irish descent. Affected family members present with a beta-thalassemia minor phenotype, normal Hb A2 and Hb F levels. Genomic blotting analyses on DNA from affected family members show heterozygosity for a large deletion beginning at least 15 kb upstream of the 5' endpoint of the gamma delta beta-thalassemia-1 deletion, extending through the entire beta-like globin gene cluster, and continuing for at least 10 kb beyond the 3' endpoint of the deletion associated with the Spanish form of delta beta 0-thalassemia. This deletion is among the largest described so far, and removes at least 205 kb encompassing the entire beta-like globin gene cluster on chromosome 11.
