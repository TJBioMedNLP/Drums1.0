Pendred syndrome, DFNB4, and PDS/SLC26A4 identification of eight novel mutations and possible genotype-phenotype correlations.
Mutations in PDS (SLC26A4) cause both Pendred syndrome and DFNB4, two autosomal recessive disorders that share hearing loss as a common feature. The hearing loss is associated with temporal bone abnormalities, ranging from isolated enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (dilated vestibular aqueduct, DVA) to Mondini dysplasia, a complex malformation in which the normal cochlear spiral of 2(1/2) turns is replaced by a hypoplastic coil of 1(1/2) turns. In Pendred syndrome, thyromegaly also develops, although affected persons usually remain euthyroid. We identified PDS mutations in the proband of 14 of 47 simplex families (30%) and nine of 11 multiplex families (82%) (P=0.0023). In all cases, mutations segregated with the disease state in multiplex families. Included in the 15 different PDS allele variants we found were eight novel mutations. The two most common mutations, T416P and IVS8+1G>A, were present in 22% and 30% of families, respectively. The finding of PDS mutations in five of six multiplex families with DVA (83%) and four of five multiplex families with Mondini dysplasia (80%) implies that mutations in this gene are the major genetic cause of these temporal anomalies. Comparative analysis of phenotypic and genotypic data supports the hypothesis that the type of temporal bone anomaly may depend on the specific PDS allele variant present.
