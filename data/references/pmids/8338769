Functional analysis of the 4 bp deletion identified in the 5' untranslated region of one of the beta-globin genes from a Chinese beta-thalassaemic heterozygote.
Two plasmids have been constructed in which a beta-galactosidase/phleomycin-resistance fusion gene reporter is placed under the control of the human beta-globin gene promoter and 5' untranslated region including or not including nucleotides 40-43 previously found deleted in one Chinese beta-thalassaemic allele. Transient expression assays of these two plasmids failed to reveal any significative effect of this 4 bp deletion either on the level of the beta-galactosidase activity produced in HeLa cells transfected in standard conditions, or on the rate of synthesis of the beta-galactosidase protein in transfected HeLa cells submitted to increasing osmotic shocks. These results suggest that this 4 bp deletion is not responsible for the beta-thalassaemic phenotype in vivo.
