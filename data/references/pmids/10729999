Mutations of the WASP gene in 10 Japanese patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and X-linked thrombocytopenia.
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, immunodeficiency, and eczema. X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT) is a mild form of WAS with isolated thrombocytopenia. Both phenotypes are caused by mutation of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) gene. In this study, we identified mutations of the WASP gene in 10 Japanese patients from 9 unrelated families with WAS/XLT. All XLT patients (n = 3) and one WAS patient had a missense mutation at the PH domain of WASP. Two WAS patients had nonsense mutations. One WAS patient had exon 8 skipping caused by one nucleotide deletion at the acceptor site of intron 7. Three WAS patients had genomic deletions; one of the three had a large genomic deletion involving exons 3 to 7. Codons 45 and 86 seem to be the hot spots of the WASP mutation, because missense mutations in these codons have been reported previously in several WAS/XLT patients in addition to the patients in this report, and patients with the same mutation show a similar clinical phenotype. All other mutations are novel, indicating that the mutations of WASP are heterogeneous. EB virus-transformed cell lines from XLT patients expressed nearly normal amounts of WASP, whereas those from typical WAS patients expressed almost undetectable amounts of WASP. We conclude that the analysis of gene mutation and protein expression of WASP are useful together in assessing the severity of WAS.
