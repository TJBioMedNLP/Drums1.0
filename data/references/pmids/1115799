Two new hemoglobins. Hemoglobin Alabama (beta39(C5)Gln leads to Lys) and hemoglobin Montgomery (alpha 48(CD 6) Leu leads to Arg).
The amino acid substitutions in two new hemoglobins found by electrophoretic screening during a survey in Alabama have been determined by column chromatography and amino acid analyses of their tryptic peptides. They are hemoglobin Alabama (beta 39(C 5)Gln leads to Lys) and hemoglobin Montgomery (alpha 48(CD 6) Leu leads to Arg). No harmful symptoms have been attributed to the presence of either hemoglobin.
