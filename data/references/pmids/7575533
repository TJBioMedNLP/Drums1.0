Galactose stabilizes various missense mutants of alpha-galactosidase in Fabry disease.
The effect of galactose on alpha-galactosidase missense mutants causing Fabry disease was investigated in the COS-1 cell expression system and lymphoblasts. Three mutant enzymes, A156V, L166V and Q279E, showed increases in activity and amount in COS-1 cells cultured with galactose. Another mutant without catalytic activity, C142Y, did not show any changes. In lymphoblasts cultured with galactose, the enzyme activity increased significantly in four classical Fabry patients with the respective mutations, A156V, L166V, G260A and G373S, and in three atypical Fabry patients with the respective mutations, Q279E, R301Q and M296I. Such an increase was not observed in the other four classical Fabry patients, with C142Y, E66Q/R112C, G328R and N320K, respectively. This suggests that many missense mutations in the alpha-galactosidase gene causing Fabry disease allow the expression of catalytically active mutant enzymes regardless of the clinical phenotype, which are rapidly degraded under physiological conditions and stabilized by galactose.
