A case of the unstable Hb Genova (beta 28 Leu----Pro) in an Arab child associated with severe haemolytic anaemia and growth retardation.
The first case of unstable Hb Genova from North Africa is described. It was found in a 13-year-old girl from Libya suffering from chronic Heinz body haemolytic anaemia and growth retardation. The available data strongly suggest that this case represents a new example for a spontaneous mutation.
