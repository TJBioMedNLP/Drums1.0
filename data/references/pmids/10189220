Novel mutations in African American patients with glycogen storage disease Type II. Mutations in brief no. 209. Online.
The infantile form of GSD II (an inherited deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme, acid alpha-glucosidase, Pompe disease) is a severe and invariably fatal disease characterized by a rapidly progressive generalized hypotonia, hepatomegaly, and cardiomegaly. We have recently demonstrated that African American patients share a common nonsense R854X mutation in exon 18 (Becker et al., 1998). Two other mutations, D645E and M519V, have been identified in individual African American patients (Hermans et al., 1993a; Huie et al., 1994a). We describe here three novel mutations in this population group: a missense W481R in exon 10, a deletion of a T1441 in exon 10, and a splicing defect at the 5' donor site of intron 8 (IVS g+la) . The splicing defect is shared by two unrelated patients and it is linked to intragenic polymorphic sites identical to those found in patients bearing the common R854X mutation.
