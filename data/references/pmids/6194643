Spanish delta-beta-thalassemia: hematological studies and composition of the gamma-chains in ten homozygous patients.
We report the hematological studies and the composition of the gamma-chains of 10 homozygous delta beta(0)-thalassemia patients belonging to 6 families. These patients showed a mild to moderate chronic hemolytic anemia, morphological changes typical of thalassemia and 100% fetal hemoglobin in their peripheral blood. The homozygous studied synthesized A gamma- and G gamma-chains in approximately equal amounts, and the fetal hemoglobin with a threonyl residue at position 75 is present and accounts for all the A gamma production.
