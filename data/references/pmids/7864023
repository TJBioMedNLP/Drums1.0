Initiation codon mutation (ATG --> ATA) of the beta-globin gene causing beta-thalassemia in a Swedish family.
An initiation codon mutation ATG-->ATA of the beta-globin gene was found in seven members of three generations of a family living in northern Sweden. This mutation, which has not previously been described, changes the initiation codon for methionine into a codon for isoleucine and will then result in a beta zero-thalassemic phenotype. The affected family members all present hematological findings typical for beta-thalassemic trait, with slight anemia, marked microcytosis, and increased levels of Hb A2.
