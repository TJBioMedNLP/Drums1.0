Molecular identification of the novel Ggamma-beta hybrid hemoglobin: Hb Ggamma-beta Ulsan (Ggamma through 13; beta from 19).
Gene fusion is a very rare mechanism that produces hemoglobin variants. Less than ten types of beta-like hybrid globins have been reported to date. Herein we identified the first hybrid hemoglobin between Ggamma- and beta-globins in a five-year-old Korean male who had thalassemia minor feature and triplication of the HBA2 gene (alphaalpha/alphaalphaalphaalpha). The novel globin originated from a 27,707-base pair deletion spanning from the HBG2 to HBB gene (NG_000007.3:g.42947_70653del). Its protein sequence included 13 N-terminal amino acids from Ggamma-globin, five common amino acids from Ggamma- and beta-globins, and 128 amino acids from beta-globin (Ggamma through 13; beta from 19). Molecular genetic analyses characterized the hybrid DNA and RNA. Mass spectrometry and de novo protein sequencing successfully identified the fusion peptide in the hybrid hemoglobin. We named this novel hybrid Hb Ggamma-beta Ulsan. The novel hemoglobin constituted 37.0% of the total hemoglobin and showed reduced oxygen affinity.
