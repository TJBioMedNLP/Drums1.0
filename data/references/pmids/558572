A new hybrid haemoglobin: haemoglobin Strumica/Beograd occurring in an individual with four haemoglobins.
An investigation of the cord blood from full term twin infants revealed an additional haemoglobin F component due to an abnormal alpha chain. The father of the twins, whose blood picture was normal, was shown to have normal alpha and beta polypeptide chains together with variant alpha and beta polypeptide chains. Electrophoresis showed that he had four major haemoglobin components. Separation of the haemoglobin fractions by column chromatography, globin preparation, chain separation, tryptic and chymotryptic digestion and peptide map preparation led to the identification of haemaglobin A, haemoglobin Strumica (alpha2 112His leads to Arg beta2), haemoglobin D Beograd (alpha2beta2 121 Glu leads to Val) and a hybrid haemoglobin Strumica D/Beograd (alpha2 112His leads to Argbeta2 121Glu leads to Val).
