Hemoglobin Beth Israel. A mutant causing clinically apparent cyanosis.
We found that an abnormal hemoglobin with a very low oxygen affinity was responsible for overt cyanosis in an otherwise healthy adolescent. Hemoglobin Beth Israel, in which serine replaces the asparagine residue normally present at position 102 (G4) of the beta-polypeptide chain, was associated with normal blood counts and no apparent exercise intolerance in the heterozygous carrier. Cyanosis resulted from a drastically right-shifted oxygen dissociation curve, whose position and shape could account for the absence of "physiologic" anemia. The whole-blood oxygen tension at 50 per cent oxygen saturation was 88 mm Hg (normally 26 +/- 1 mm Hg), and the arterial blood was only 63 per cent saturated with oxygen despite a normal oxygen tension of 97 mm Hg. The hemolysate showed a low oxygen affinity but normal Bohr effect. Unexplained cyanosis, particularly in association with normal arterial oxygen tension should prompt a search for an abnormal hemoglobin, which may obviate the need for invasive diagnostic procedures.
