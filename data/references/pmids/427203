Haemoglobin Avicenna (beta 47 (CD6) Asp replaced by Ala). A new abnormal haemoglobin.
In a survey for abnormal haemoglobin variants in voluntary blood donors in Iran, a new variant was found in a young male who presented no clinical symptoms. It had the same electrophoretic mobility as haemoglobin D in alkaline buffers. Separation of the constituent polypeptide chains in acid urea buffer revealed it to be different from haemoglobin D previously found among Iranians. Analysis of its structure demonstrated a substitution to alanine (beta 47 Asp replaced by Ala) in the same residue as involved in haemoglobin G-Copenhagen (beta 47 Asp replaced by Asn).
