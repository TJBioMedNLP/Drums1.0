Some rare hemoglobin variants with altered oxygen affinities; Hb linkoping [beta 36(C2)Pro----Thr], Hb Caribbean [beta 91(F7)Leu----Arg], and Hb Sunnybrook [beta 36(C2)Pro----Arg].
A few rare hemoglobin variants with altered functional properties have been observed in Canadian subjects with either an erythrocytosis or mild anemia. These variants were Hb Alberta [beta 101(G3)Glu----Gly], Hb Linkoping [beta 36(C2)Pro----Thr], a new variant Hb Sunnybrook [beta 36(C2)Pro----Arg], and Hb Caribbean [beta 91(F7)Leu----Arg]. Short clinical descriptions of the subjects are given, the characterization of the variants is described in detail (except for Hb Alberta), while data from some functional analyses are provided. Comparisons with previously published data have been made and the unusual chromatographic property of two abnormal beta chains in a reversed phase high performance liquid chromatographic system is reviewed.
