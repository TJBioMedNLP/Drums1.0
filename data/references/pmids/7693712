Two additional cases of osteogenesis imperfecta with substitutions for glycine in the alpha 2(I) collagen chain. A regional model relating mutation location with phenotype.
The relationship between the clinical severity of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and the location and type of amino acid substitution in type I collagen is not identical for mutations in the alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) chains. Furthermore, the alpha 2(I) chain, once thought to be associated with moderate forms of OI, has now been associated with approximately as many lethal as non-lethal cases. We describe two novel substitutions for glycine in the alpha 2(I) chain, one associated with a lethal phenotype in twins and the other with a moderate non-lethal phenotype. The type I collagen of all probands was characterized electrophoretically by two populations of alpha chains, one normal and one with delayed migration. Cyanogen bromide peptides of the overmodified alpha 1(I) chains revealed delayed migration of all peptides except CB6. The indicated target region of alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) cDNA of the probands was analyzed by RNA-DNA hybrid analysis with RNase A digestion. All probands had mismatches in the region of alpha 2(I) coding for amino acids 642-912. The lethal phenotype was associated with a G-->A mutation, resulting in Gly706-->serine; the non-lethal mutation was a G-->T change resulting in Gly676-->valine. Both mutations occurred de novo in the probands; parental leukocyte DNA was normal. In conjunction with the previously described exon deletions and point mutations in alpha 2(I), these mutations define five alternating non-lethal/lethal regions along the chain and support a regional, as opposed to a gradient, model of OI pathophysiology. These mutations in particular help to define a lethal/non-lethal junction at about alpha 2(I) amino acid 700.
