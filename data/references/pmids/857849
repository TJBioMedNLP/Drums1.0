Haemoglobin Radcliffe (alpha2beta299(Gi)Ala): a high oxygen-affinity variant causing familial polycythaemia.
Three members of an Oxfordshire family have polycythaemia. In each case their whole-blood oxygen affinity is increased. This is due to a previously undescribed haemoglobin variant which has been named haemoglobin Radcliffe (alpha2beta299(Gl)Ala). In addition to having a high oxygen affinity haemoglobin Radcliffe shows virtually no haem-haem interaction and a diminished Bohr effect. It is synthesized at the same rate and is as stable as haemoglobin A. X-ray analysis indicates that crystals of deoxyhaemoglobin Radcliffe are isomorphous with those of deoxyhaemoglobin A. Solutions of haemoglobin Radcliffe were also studied by high-resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The structure/function relationships of haemoglobin Radcliffe are discussed in the light of these studies.
