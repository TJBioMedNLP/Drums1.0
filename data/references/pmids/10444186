Identification of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency by mutation analysis of blood and hair roots.
Severe combined immunodeficiency is a heterogenous syndrome of varied genetic origins of which the X-linked type is the commonest (XSCID). The most sensitive method for diagnosis of XSCID in the absence of X-linked inheritance pattern is by mutation analysis. In this report we have performed mutation analysis in 13 unrelated boys transplanted (BMT) for SCID without a known cause to determine the frequency of XSCID. Five boys had an affected male relative. We also assessed the utility of hair roots for children without pre-transplant blood stored for mutation analysis since donor genotype was expressed in peripheral blood post BMT. Screening was performed by analysis of single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) followed by sequencing of candidate exons. Mutations were found in 11 cases, of which six were sporadic, and maternal mosaicism was found in one family. Three mothers of the six sporadic cases were identified as carriers. The majority (6/8) of boys with SCID had gammac deficiency despite the absence of X-linked inheritance pattern. The significant frequency of de novo mutations and the occurrence of maternal germline mosaicism highlights the importance of mutation analysis. The strategy of using DNA from hair roots was particularly valuable where no pre-transplant blood was stored. Characterization of the mutations will also enable research into the correction of these genetic defects.
