Identification of two novel and four uncommon missense mutations among chinese Gaucher disease patients.
Gaucher disease is the most prevalent lysosomal storage disease. It is panethnic and results from an inherited deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. Most mutations to date have been identified among Jewish and non-Jewish Caucasian patients; mutations in Chinese patients are largely unknown. We have performed nucleotide sequence analysis of PCR-amplified glucocerebrosidase genomic DNA from five unrelated Chinese patients affected with type 1 (non-neuropathic) Gaucher disease. A novel heterozygous C --> T mutation at cDNA nucleotide position 475 (R120W) was detected in a patient who is also heterozygous for a C --> T transition at cDNA nucleotide position 259 (R48W). In a second patient, a novel, heterozygous T --> G transversion at cDNA 226 (F37V) was detected. Mutation 1448 (L444P), the most prevalent mutation among non-Jewish Caucasian Gaucher patients, was found in the heterozygous form in four patients. The mutations in the second Gaucher allele in the other three patients are mutations 254 (G46E), 680 (N188S), and 754 (F213I), which were recently reported in Korean, Arab, and Chinese (Taiwanese) patients. We have developed screening methods that utilize PCR amplification of glucocerebrosidase genomic DNA and Eco571, Nci1, Hinc11, BsaJ1, and Bsr1 restriction endonuclease analyses for the detection of each of these mutations. The population genetics of some of these Gaucher alleles and their implications in genotype/phenotype correlation are discussed.
