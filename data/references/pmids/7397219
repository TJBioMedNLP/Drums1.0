Hemoglobin Pasadena,alpha 2 beta 275(E19)Leu leads to Arg. Identification by high performance liquid chromatography of a new unstable variant with increased oxygen affinity.
This report describes structural and functional characteristics of a new hemoglobin variant, Hb Pasadena [beta 75(E19)Leu leads to Arg] and illustrates the use of high performance liquid chromatography in the analysis of the substitution. As a consequence of this substitution, there is compensated hemolysis, instability, increased oxygen affinity, and reduced cooperativily. However, the health of the individual is hardly affected.
