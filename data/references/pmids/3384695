Hb Tunis [alpha 2 beta 2 124 (H2)Pro----Ser], a new beta chain variant identified by HPLC.
During a routine hematological investigation of a child from Tunis, a silent hemoglobin variant was discovered by isoelectric-focusing. This variant was not detectable by conventional electrophoretic methods, had normal stability, expression, and oxygen affinity, and did not produce any clinical symptoms. This new variant beta 124(H2)Pro----Ser was named Hb Tunis.
