Mutation in human desmoplakin domain binding to plakoglobin causes a dominant form of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is a genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by progressive degeneration of the right ventricular myocardium and increased risk of sudden death. Here, we report on a genome scan in one Italian family in which the disease appeared unlinked to any of the six different ARVD loci reported so far; we identify a mutation (S299R) in exon 7 of desmoplakin (DSP), which modifies a putative phosphorylation site in the N-terminal domain binding plakoglobin. It is interesting that a nonsense DSP mutation was reported elsewhere in the literature, inherited as a recessive trait and causing a biventricular dilative cardiomyopathy associated with palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hairs. Therefore, different DSP mutations might produce different clinical phenotypes, with different modes of inheritance.
