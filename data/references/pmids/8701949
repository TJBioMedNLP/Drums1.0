Hemoglobin S/hemoglobin Osler: a case with 3 beta globin chains. DNA sequence (AAT) proves that Hb Osler is beta 145 Tyr-->Asn.
A 13-year-old African-American female with erythrocytosis and three different beta globins on electrophoresis beta A, beta S, and beta Osler, raised the possibility that one chromosome 11 might contain a duplicated beta globin gene, since there are normally only 2 beta globin genes. DNA sequence analysis showed GTG at codon 6 in exon 1, corresponding to Hb S and AAT at codon 145 in exon 3, indicating a substitution of Asn for Tyr. Thus, Hb Osler undergoes spontaneous post-translational deamidation, beta 145 Asn-->beta 145 Asp. Unmodified Hb Osler (Asn) co-migrates with Hb A on electrophoresis and co-elutes with Hb A on HPLC; therefore it has not been identified previously. All previous studies have incorrectly identified the mutation as being beta 145 (HC 2) Tyr-->Asp.
