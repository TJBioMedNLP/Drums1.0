Hemoglobin Roseau-Pointe a Pitre alpha 2 beta 2(90) (F6) Glu----Gly: a new hemoglobin variant with slight instability and low oxygen affinity.
A Dominican neonate carrying a new abnormal hemoglobin, hemoglobin Roseau Pointe-a-Pitre alpha 2 beta 2(90)(F6) Glu----Gly, was detected in Guadeloupe during application of a cord blood screening program. This variant behaved in isoelectrofocusing as an Hb D, and displayed instability and low whole blood oxygen affinity. In the affected family it was present, either isolated, or in association with a beta+ thalassemia trait.
