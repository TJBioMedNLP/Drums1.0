Hemoglobin New Mexico: beta 100 (G2) Pro----Arg. A variant hemoglobin associated with erythrocytosis.
Hemoglobin New Mexico beta 100 Pro----Arg was found in a 4-year-old black male and represents a new mutation. The propositus is also heterozygous for Hb S. The variant shows high oxygen affinity, reduced cooperatively, and a lowered alkaline Bohr effect. Addition of allosteric effectors leads to improved cooperativity and a Bohr effect that is similar to that of Hb A. The high percentage of the variant (53.5%) and its increased oxygen affinity result in erythrocytosis in this patient. The hemoglobin level and packed cell volume values are elevated. In spite of these factors the patient appears healthy and shows no discomfort. The altered oxygen-linked properties of this variant can be related to the fact that the substituted residue contributes to the alpha 2 beta 1/alpha 1 beta 2 subunit interface, an area that is critical not only to the allosteric transitions between the oxy and deoxy states but also to stabilizing the hemoglobin tetrameer.
