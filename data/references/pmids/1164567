A Swiss family with hemoglobin P Galveston beta117His leads to Arg, including two patients with hb P/beta thalassemia.
The mutant Hb P Galveston (beta117His leads to Arg) is observed in two heterozygotes for beta thalassemia and by itself does not cause clinical symptoms. Some of the physico-chemical properties of Hb P Galveston are identical to the onemical properties of Hb P Galveston are identical to the ones hemoglobin Zurich (beta 63 His leads to Arg) so that only a detailed analysis led to its proper identification.
