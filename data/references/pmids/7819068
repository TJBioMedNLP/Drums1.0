Homozygous beta-thalassaemia resulting in the beta-thalassaemia carrier state phenotype.
This paper describes the phenotypic manifestations of a very mild beta-thalassaemia mutation detected in several members of two families of Italian descent. The molecular defect, defined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis and direct sequencing, consists of a C-->G substitution at position 844 of IVSII of the beta-globin gene within the consensus sequence of the IVSII acceptor splice site. Heterozygotes for this mutation show a haematological phenotype ranging in severity from silent beta-thalassaemia to that of a mild beta-thalassaemia carrier state, whereas homozygotes have the typical manifestations commonly resulting from heterozygosity for a beta-thalassaemia mutation. Compound heterozygotes for the IVSII nt844 (C-->G) mutation and a severe beta-thalassaemia mutation have the phenotype of thalassaemia intermedia. This paper indicates that the presence of borderline red blood cell indices or HbA2 values should make one suspect the presence of a very mild or silent beta-thalassaemia.
