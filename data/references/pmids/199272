Haemoglobin North Shore, beta134 Val replaced by Glu, a new unstable haemoglobin.
A new mildly unstable haemoglobin, Hb North Shore (beta134 Val replaced by Glu) is described. It was found in a 4th generation Australian of Anglo-Celtic origin with a mild microcytic anaemia. The charge change involved is partially obscured as evidenced by the electrophoretic mobility of the native haemoglobin. The structural studies illustrate the usefulness of Staphylococcus aureus strain V8 protease as a specific cleavage enzyme at glutamyl residues.
