DNA sequence analysis proves Hb M-Milwaukee-2 is due to beta-globin gene codon 92 (CAC-->TAC), the presumed mutation of Hb M-Hyde Park and Hb M-Akita.
Among the causes of congenital methemoglobinemia, Hb M-Milwaukee-2 was one of the earliest described, in a patient who also had Hb E trait. The structure of Hb M-Milwaukee-2 has been elusive. DNA sequence analysis, as here reported, proves that this hemoglobin variant is due to the mutation CAC-->TAC at codon 92 of the beta-globin gene, corresponding to the substitution of tyrosine for histidine. This mutation is identical with that presumed to be the cause of Hb M-Hyde Park and Hb M-Akita. In addition, the DNA mutation of Hb E, GAG-->AAG at codon 26, was confirmed in this case.
