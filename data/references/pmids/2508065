Comparison of RNase A, a chemical cleavage and GC-clamped denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis for the detection of mutations in exon 9 of the human acid beta-glucosidase gene.
Gaucher disease (GD), which results from mutations in the human acid beta-glucosidase (beta-Glc) gene, was used as a model system to compare the utility of three methods capable of detecting single base substitutions. PCR-amplified beta-Glc exon 9 sequences of GD patients were screened for single base mutations by GC-clamped denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and RNase A cleavage of RNA-DNA heteroduplexes, and by chemical (hydroxylamine/osmium tetroxide) cleavage of dsDNA heteroduplexes. PCR products showing abnormal behaviour were cloned and sequenced. Three new point mutations were detected by this strategy. A G to C (Asp409 to His409) substitution was present in two Type 1 and one Type 3 GD patients; an A to T transversion (Asp409 to Val409) was detected in only a single Type 3 individual, and a G to T mutation (Val394 to Leu394) was present in one Type 1 and one Type 3 patient. GD thus exhibits extensive molecular heterogeneity, with at least five single base mutations in beta-Glc exon 9. In every case verified by ASO hybridization, DGGE had correctly identified the presence of the three new mutations, as well as the two previously described exon 9 mutations. In comparison, although RNase A and the chemical method were both able to detect some of these mutations, neither method reproducibly detected all of them. Additionally, DGGE was the only method that was able to reliably determine whether a given mutation was present homozygously or heterozygously. These results suggest that GC-clamped DGGE may be a more reliable and informative screening method for point mutation detection.
