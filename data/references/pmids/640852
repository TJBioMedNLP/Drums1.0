Clinical and hematological studies in a family with hemoglobin Vancouver.
Hb Vancouver (alpha2beta2 73 (E17) ASP yieldTYR) was found in combination with betaomicron thalassemia trait in a Chinese male who presented with splenomegaly and thalassemia intermedia (3). The family study has revealed two members with beta thalassemia trait, one heterozygote for Hb E, and two heterozygotes for Hb Vancouver. The Hb Vancouver heterozygotes were clinically normal but their erythrocytes showed reduced osmotic fragility and occasional target cells.
