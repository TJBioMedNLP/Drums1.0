Filipino beta-thalassemia due to a large deletion: identification of the deletion endpoints and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnosis.
The gene frequency of beta-thalassemia among Filipinos is estimated to be 0.02, although little is known about the mutations involved. Recently, an extensive beta-thalassemia deletion was reported in several unrelated individuals of Filipino descent. The deletion begins approximately 4 kb upstream of the beta-globin gene, and extends 3' beyond the beta-globin gene. In this report, we identify the 5' and 3' deletion endpoints and present a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategy for rapid DNA diagnosis of the Filipino beta-thalassemia deletion.
