Cardiac ion channel gene mutations in sudden infant death syndrome.
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is multifactorial and may result from the interaction of a number of environmental, genetic, and developmental factors. We studied three major genes causing long QT syndrome in 42 Japanese SIDS victims and found five mutations, KCNQ1-K598R, KCNH2-T895M, SCN5A-F532C, SCN5A-G1084S, and SCN5A-F1705S, in four cases; one case had both KCNH2-T895M and SCN5A-G1084S. All mutations were novel except for SCN5A-F532C, which was previously detected in an arrhythmic patient. Heterologous expression study revealed significant changes in channel properties of KCNH2-T895M, SCN5A-G1084S, and SCN5A-F1705S, but did not in KCNQ1-K598R and SCN5A-F532C. Our data suggests that nearly 10% of SIDS victims in Japan have mutations of the cardiac ion channel genes similar to in other countries.
