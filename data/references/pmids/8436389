Molecular characterization of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants from Brazil.
Electrophoretic surveys of 7794 individuals from different regions of Brazil and a study of subjects with hemolytic anemia have disclosed 9 putative G6PD variants in addition to the B, A, A-, and Mediterranean types. No variants were found among the 3739 Brazilian Indians tested. Four variants underwent DNA analysis. Three were identified with the Mediterranean, Seattle, and Anaheim types, but the fourth variant was previously undescribed and we propose to designate it G6PD Sao Borja.
