A new hemoglobin with high oxygen affinity--hemoglobin bunbury: alpha 2 beta 2 [94 (FG1) Asp replaced by Asn].
Hemoglobin Bunbury was detected in an Italian woman from Bunbury, Western Australia, following detection of an abnormal hemoglobin by electrophoresis. The variant form accounted for 38% of the total hemoglobin and migrated on cellulose acetate electrophoresis between HbS and HbA. Structural analysis demonstrated a new substitution in the beta chain, beta 94 Asp replaced by Asn. Hemoglobin Bunbury is stable to both heat and isopropanol denaturation. This variant shows an increase in oxygen affinity and a reduced Bohr effect. Heterozygosity for Hb Bunbury produces no clinical symptoms or compensatory erythrocytosis.
