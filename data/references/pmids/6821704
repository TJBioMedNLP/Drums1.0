Hemoglobin North Shore: a variant hemoglobin associated with the phenotype of beta-thalassemia.
Hemoglobin (Hb) North Shore (beta 134 val leads to glu) is a mutant hemoglobin that is associated with the phenotype of mild heterozygous beta-thalassemia. Heterozygotes are characterized low normal hemoglobin levels or mild anemia, microcytosis, increased HbA2, and 34%-38% Hb North Shore. The mechanism of the anemia and microcytosis associated with Hb North Shore was explored by studies of hemolysate thermal instability, peripheral blood globin biosynthesis, and whole blood oxygen affinity. Hb North Shore was mildly heat unstable in comparison to normal adult hemolysate. Pulse labeling of reticulocytes with 3H-leucine showed an alpha/beta ratio of 1.35 (normal 1.0). The beta North Shore/alpha ratio was 0.22-0.27, which was less than expected on the basis of gene dosage and less than that seen for most beta-chain variants. The beta A/alpha ratio was 0.50, as would be expected. The beta North Shore/alpha ratio was 0.26 after a 15-min pulse and did not decrease during 120 min of chase. These findings suggest that suboptimal synthesis rather than posttranslational degradation is responsible for the thalassemic phenotype associated with this variant hemoglobin. These observations parallel the findings in heterozygous HbE. It is not presently known whether the thalassemia phenotype is conferred by the structural mutation itself or by another mutation cis to the beta North Shore gene.
