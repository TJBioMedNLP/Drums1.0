Dissecting aortic aneurysm as a complication of generalized fibromuscular dysplasia.
This is the first report of a dissecting aneurysm of the aorta caused by generalized vascular fibromuscular dysplasia. An 18-year-old black man suddenly developed paraparesis and bilateral pulse loss below the waist. An aortogram disclosed a dissecting aneurysm of the entire aorta and an obstruction of blood flow below the renal arteries. On postmortem examination, the dissection of the aorta was found to be due to fibromuscular dysplasia that affected not only the aorta, but multiple other arteries as well.
