Molecular basis of beta-thalassemia in Turkey: detection of rare mutations by direct sequencing.
Using restriction endonuclease analysis, oligonucleotide hybridization, and direct sequencing of amplified genomic DNA, we characterized 11 different mutations in the DNA of 26 patients from Turkey homozygous for beta-thalassemia. We found that mutations IVS-1 nt110, IVS-1 nt6, and the frameshift at codon 8 were the most frequent. By direct sequencing we characterized two very rare mutations not previously reported in the Turkish population: a frameshift +1 at codons 9/10 and a nonsense mutation at codon 15.
