The DSL domain in mutant JAG1 ligand is essential for the severity of the liver defect in Alagille syndrome.
Alagille syndrome (AGS) is a congenital multi-system anomaly mainly characterized by paucity of intrahepatic bile ducts caused by haploinsufficiency of the Jagged 1 gene (JAG1). To explore the relationship between genotype and phenotype, we analyzed the JAG1 gene in 25 Japanese AGS families at the genomic DNA level and identified 15 point mutations and one large deletion. Analysis of the genotype and phenotype strongly indicated that the Delta/Serrate/Lag-2 (DSL) domain in JAG1 protein played an essential role in determining the severity of the liver disorder. In four sporadic cases, missing an entire DSL domain in mutant JAG1 resulted in progressive liver failure and all 4 patients needed a liver transplant at a very young age. This correlation was further confirmed by statistical analysis (chi2=9.143, p<0.001). Our finding demonstrated that the DSL domain in JAG1 appears to be essential for normal liver development and function.
