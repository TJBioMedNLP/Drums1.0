Rhabdomyolysis in the military: recognizing late-onset very long-chain acyl Co-A dehydrogenase deficiency.
Very long-chain acyl Co-A dehydrogenase deficiency, an inborn error of lipid metabolism, is commonly thought of as a disease of infancy or early childhood. However, several cases of late-onset very long-chain acyl Co-A dehydrogenase have been reported. This report of two military men who survived basic training before their disease presentation broadens the spectrum of late-onset disease, presents two previously unreported mutations, and demonstrates the fine line between athletic, active lifestyle and severe disease presentation.
