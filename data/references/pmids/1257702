An individual with Hb-Lepore-Baltimore- delta beta-thalassaemia in a Yugoslavian family.
The clinical, haematological and biochemical findings in a person with delta beta-thalassaemia and Hb-Lepore are described. The patient was a 24-year-old student who suffered from anaemia of intermediate severity with late onset of the clinical manifestations, had minor bone and facial deformities, but had no necessity for regular transfusions. Haemoglobins A and A2 were absent in this individual, and the Hb-Lepore has been identified as Lepore-Baltimore. Heterogeneity of gamma chain of the Hb-F follows the expected pattern. The study provides further evidence that neither beta nor delta chains are synthesized in cis to delta beta-thalassaemia or Hb-Lepore.
