Hb Mobile [alpha2beta2 73(E17)Asp replaced by Val]: a new variant.
A new hemoglobin variant found in a mother and her child was characterized by column chromatography of the tryptic hydrolysate of the aminoethylated, glycinamidated beta-chain, followed by chymotryptic digestion of the abnormal beta T-9 peptide and amino acid analyses. It was shown to be alpha2beta2 73(E17)Asp replaced by Val and named by Hb Mobile.
