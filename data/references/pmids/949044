Hemoglobin Bethesda, beta 145 (HC2) Tyr replaced by His, in a Canadian family.
A hemoglobin mutant with the mobility of hemoglobin (Hb) A on alkaline cellulose acetate or starch gel electrophoresis and mobility between Hb A and Hb S on citrate agar electrophoresis was detected in a patient with erythrocytosis. Structural analysis shows a substitution of histidine by tyrosine at position 145 in the beta-chain.
