Analysis of RAB27A gene in griscelli syndrome type 2: novel mutations including a deletion hotspot.
INTRODUCTION: Griscelli syndrome type 2 is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by pigmentary dilution and occurrence of acute phases of hemophagocytosis. The disease is caused by mutations in RAB27A gene, coding a small GTPase involved in terminal phases of cytotoxic granule/melanosome exocytosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe the result of mutation analysis among nine patients from seven non-related Persian families. We present four novel mutations including a deletion hot spot (514del 5). CONCLUSION: This hot spot is flanked by "direct repeats" of nucleotides, which are previously shown to be associated with areas of recurrent small deletions.
