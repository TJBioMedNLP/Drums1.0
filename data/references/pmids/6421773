Hemoglobin Collingwood beta 60 (E4) Val replaced by Ala. A new unstable hemoglobin.
Hemoglobin Collingwood is a new unstable hemoglobin variant arising from the substitution of the internal valine at position beta 60 (E4) by alanine. The variant retains normal oxygen binding characteristics and is not associated with clinical symptoms, though there is evidence suggesting increased red cell turnover.
