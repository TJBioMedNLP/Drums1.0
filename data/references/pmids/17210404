Endovascular repair of an iliac artery aneurysm in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV.
Ehlers-Danlos type IV (EDS-IV) is an inherited condition most notable for its associated vascular complications. Patients are prone to aneurysm formation, arterial dissection, and spontaneous vessel rupture. Intervention for the vascular pathology of EDS-IV carries high morbidity and mortality. We describe a case of a 57-year-old man with EDS-IV and an expanding iliac aneurysm who underwent successful endovascular repair with a stent-graft. Endovascular aneurysm repair is feasible and should be considered for patients with EDS-IV.
