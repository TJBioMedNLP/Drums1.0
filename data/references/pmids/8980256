Genetic analysis of beta-thalassemia intermedia in Israel: diversity of mechanisms and unpredictability of phenotype.
Molecular analysis was performed on 95 Israeli patients with thalassemia intermedia, representing 60 families of Arab (Moslem and Christian), Jewish, Druze, and Samaritan origin. There was a wide range of phenotypic severity, with baseline hemoglobin levels ranging from 5.5 to 10.7. Eighteen thalassemia mutations were found (29 genotypes), which were subdivided into groups, according to the severity of mutations. A consistently mild phenotype (10 families) was caused by compound heterozygosity for a silent mutation, such as -101 C-T or by coexistence of triplicated alpha-globin genes with thalassemia trait. In 39 thalassemia intermedia families, the genotype which was found was one which led to severe thalassemia intermedia, or, in other families, was associated with thalassemia major. Elevated hemoglobin F ameliorated the disease in some patients with a severe genotype. We did not find a beneficial effect of concurrent alpha-thalassemia in any of the families studied. In 11 families, only one beta-thalassemia allele was identified. One was a dominant thalassemia intermedia allele. Three additional families with heterozygous beta-thalassemia had excess alpha-globin genes (5 or 6 total). In 7 of these heterozygotes, no explanation was found for the thalassemia intermedia phenotype. Our results suggest a substantial influence of as yet unknown genetic modifiers. These findings have important implications for prenatal diagnosis and for the genetic counseling of families with thalassemia intermedia.
