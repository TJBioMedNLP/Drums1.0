Beta thalassemia due to a novel mutation in IVS 1 sequence donor site consensus sequence creating a restriction site.
During a systematic screening of Algerian thalassemics by determining the DNA polymorphism haplotypes in the beta globin gene cluster, a novel haplotype was identified. The DNA of a homozygous individual was cloned and sequenced. The mutation, a G----A change, at position 5 of the small intervening sequence, probably interferes with normal splicing events, and, moreover, creates a new Eco RV restriction site that provides a useful diagnostic tool for detecting this condition.
