Characterization of a new electrophoretically silent hemoglobin variant. Hb saale OR alpha 2beta 2 84(EF8)Thr --> Ala.
A new abnormal hemoglobin was detected in a young German anemic patient by cation-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Using a combination of electrospray mass spectrometry, HPLC, direct sequencing, and family screening with polymerase chain reaction/restriction digestion approach, we have characterized this hemoglobin variant as resulting from a Thr --> Ala replacement at beta84(EF8). It could be separated neither by electrophoresis nor by isoelectric focusing. Hb Saale is slightly unstable, exhibiting a moderate tendency to auto-oxidize. Functional properties and the heterotropic interactions are similar to those of Hb A.
