A mild type of Hb S-beta(+)-thalassemia [-92(C-->T)] in a Sicilian family.
Hematological data are presented for an adult Sicilian patient with a mild Hb S-beta(+)-thalassemia caused by a C-->T mutation at position -92 of the beta promoter. This mutation was identified by sequencing of amplified DNA and was confirmed by dot-blot analysis with specific probes. A comparison of levels of Hb S and Hb A in Hb S-beta-thalassemia patients with different beta-thalassemia alleles showed great variations; the highest level of Hb A (45%) was recorded in the patient with Hb S-beta(+)-thalassemia [-92(C-->T)] and the lowest (approximately 13%) in patients with Hb S-beta(+)-thalassemia [IVS-II-745 (C-->G)]. Clinical severity is directly related to the level of Hb A present.
