Detection of mutations in human type I collagen mRNA in osteogenesis imperfecta by indirect RNase protection.
A method for detecting a wide variety of mutations within type I collagen has been developed and evaluated on a series of patients with osteogenesis imperfecta. RNA, extracted from the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartment of cultured fibroblasts from affected individuals, is hybridized with antisense single-stranded cDNA to the alpha 1(I) mRNA. The hybrid is digested with RNase A and T1 under varying degrees of stringency. The resistant RNA bands are separated by electrophoresis in agarose, transferred to nitrocellulose, and hybridized with antisense cRNA colinear with the protecting probe. This approach is capable of detecting previously defined mutations such as 252-base pair deletion and a 1-base pair mismatch within the alpha 1(I) mRNA. The method appears to be particularly useful in detecting abnormalities of RNA processing that behave as an insert or deletion within the mature mRNA. The procedure should be generally applicable for the identification and localization of any mutation within an entire gene if the gene is expressed as an RNA and a complete cDNA for the mRNA is available.
