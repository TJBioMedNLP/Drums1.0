Performance of speech perception after cochlear implantation in DFNB1 patients.
CONCLUSION: There were no apparent differences in speech performance after cochlear implantation between patients with biallelic GJB2 and/or GJB6 mutations and those with deafness of unknown aetiology. These data have important implications for the selection of prognostic indicators of the outcome of cochlear implantation. OBJECTIVE: To compare performance after cochlear implantation in children with mutations in GJB2 (connexin 26) and/or GJB6 (connexin 30) and children with deafness of unknown aetiology. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Genetic analysis and speech performance evaluation was determined in 24 patients with (n=11) and without (n=13) biallelic GJB2 and/or GJB6 mutations who underwent cochlear implantation. Speech perception skills were measured 12 and 24 months after surgery. Each patient was classified in accordance with the speech perception category (SPC). RESULTS: Overall, the two groups showed similar significant improvement in speech perception after implantation.
