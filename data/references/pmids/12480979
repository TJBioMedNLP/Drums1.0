Clinical features and genetic analysis of a Chinese kindred with Fabry's disease.
BACKGROUND: Fabry's disease is an X-linked recessive inborn error of glycosphingolipid catabolism resulting from deficient activity of lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A causing occlusive microvascular diseases affecting the kidney, heart, peripheral nerves and brain. It is an uncommon disease in the Oriental population. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report a Chinese kindred of Fabry's disease and the relevant clinical features are discussed. The diagnosis of Fabry's disease was based on serum alpha-galactosidase A activity and typical histological features from renal biopsy in the index patient. Genetic analysis of two hemizygous male patients revealed a missense mutation predicting a leucine to proline substitution (L14P) in the alpha-galactosidase gene causing classical Fabry's disease in this family. This is a novel point mutation not described previously in the literature and the second report describing novel genetic mutations for Fabry's disease in Chinese patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fabry's disease is rare in Chinese patients but this diagnosis should be considered in patients with positive family history of kidney disease and relevant clinical features.
