Connexin 26 mutations in cases of sensorineural deafness in eastern Austria.
Mutations in the connexin 26 (Cx26) gene (GJB2) are associated with autosomal nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. This study describes mutations in the Cx26 gene in cases of familial and sporadic hearing loss (HL) by gene sequencing and identifies the allelic frequency of the most common mutation leading to HL (35delG) in the population of eastern Austria. For this purpose we have developed and applied a molecular beacon based real-time mutation detection assay. Mutation frequencies in the Cx26 gene of individuals from affected families (14 out of 46) and sporadic cases (11 out of 40) were 30.4% and 27.5%, respectively. In addition to known disease related alterations, a novel mutation 262 G-->T (A88S) was also identified. 35delG accounted for almost 77% of all Cx26 mutations detected and displayed an allelic frequency in the normal hearing population of 1.7% (2 out of 120). The high prevalence of the 35delG mutation in eastern Austria would therefore allow screening of individuals and family members with Cx26 dependent deafness by a highly specific and semi-automated method.
