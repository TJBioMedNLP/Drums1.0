A distinct spectrum of SLC26A4 mutations in patients with enlarged vestibular aqueduct in China.
There is a worldwide interest in studying SLC26A4 mutations that are responsible for enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) in different ethnic background and populations. The spectrum of SLC26A4 mutations in Chinese population is yet to be fully characterized. In this study, all the 21 exons of SLC26A4 were screened in 107 Chinese patients with hearing loss associated with EVA or both EVA and Mondini dysplasia (MD), taken from six multiplex and 95 simplex families. The two types of control populations consisted of 84 normal-hearing subjects and 46 sensorineural hearing loss subjects without inner ear malformations. Biallelic mutations were found in 12 patients from multiplex families and 84 patients (88.4%) from the simplex families. In addition, monoallelic variant was detected in nine patients in the remaining 11 simplex families. Overall, up to 97.9% patients were found having at least one possible pathogenic variant in SLC26A4, with most having biallelic variants consistent with recessive inheritance of this disorder. A total of 40 mutations including 25 novel mutations were identified in the Chinese patients but were not detected in all the controls except for one normal subject. For the Chinese mutation spectrum of SLC26A4 gene, IVS 7-2A>G mutation was the most common form accounting for 57.63% (102/177) of all the mutant alleles.
