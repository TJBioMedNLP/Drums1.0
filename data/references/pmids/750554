Hemoglobin Hofu or alpha 2 beta 2 [126 (H4) Va1 leads to Glu] found in combination with hemoglobin S.
Hb Hofu, alpha 2 beta 2 [126 (H4) Va1 leads to Glu], was found in 10 members of 2 apparently unrelated Valmiki families in central India. None showed evidence of hemolysis and hemoglobin levels were normal in most. In two individuals, Hb Hofu occurred in combination with Hg S, but neither had clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease. In samples containing Hb Hofu, the isopropanol precipitation test was positive. Quantitation of the hemoglobin fractions by DEAE-cellulose chromatography showed that Hb Hofu constituted a mean of 23--25% of the total whether in combination with Hb A or Hb S.
