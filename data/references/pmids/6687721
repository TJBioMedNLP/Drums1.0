Hemoglobin saitama or beta 117 (G19) His leads to Pro, a new variant causing hemolytic disease.
An electrophoretically silent unstable hemoglobin was found in a 23-year-old Japanese woman suffering from hemolytic anemia and jaundice. The unstable beta subunit was precipitated with p-chloromercuribenzoic acid and the globin was further purified by urea CM-52 column chromatography. Results of amino acid analysis, tryptic fingerprinting and manual Edman degradation of the abnormal beta T12B established a substitution of proline for histidine beta 117 (G19). This new abnormal hemoglobin was absent in other members of the family.
