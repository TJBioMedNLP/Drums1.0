A single base mutation in COL5A2 causes Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type II.
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders. Recently mutations have been found in the genes for type V collagen in a small number of people with the most common forms of EDS, types I and II. Here we characterise a COL5A2 mutation in an EDS II family. Cultured dermal fibroblasts obtained from an affected subject synthesised abnormal type V collagen. Haplotype analysis excluded COL5A1 but was concordant with COL5A2 as the disease locus. The entire open reading frame of the COL5A2 cDNA was directly sequenced and a single base mutation detected. It substituted a glycine residue within the triple helical domain (G934R) of alpha2(V) collagen, typical of the dominant negative changes in other collagens, which cause various other inherited connective tissue disorders. All three affected family members possessed the single base change, which was absent in 50 normal chromosomes.
