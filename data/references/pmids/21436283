Four year follow-up of diagnostic service in USH1 patients.
Purpose: The purpose of the study was to establish the mutation spectrum of an Usher type I cohort from France containing 61 patients and to describe a diagnostic strategy, including a strategy for estimating the pathogenicity of sequence changes. Methods: To optimise the identification of Usher (USH) causative mutations, taking into account the genetic heterogeneity, preliminary haplotyping at the 5 USH1 loci was carried out to prioritize the gene to be sequenced, as previously described. Coding exons and flanking intronic sequences were sequenced and, where necessary, semi-quantitative PCR and MLPA to detect large genomic rearrangements. Results: Four years' experience confirms that the chosen approach provides an efficient diagnostic service. 61 patients showed an abnormal genotype in one of the 5 USH1 genes. We confirm genetic heterogeneity and, whilst MYO7A remains the major gene, involvement of other genes is considerable. Distribution of missense, splicing, Premature Termination Codon (PTC) (due to point substitution and small deletions/insertions) and large genomic alterations is determined among USH genes and clearly highlights the need to pay special attention to the diagnostic approach and interpretation depending on the mutated gene. Conclusions: Over the four years of a diagnostic service offering USH1 patient testing, we could identify the pathogenic genotypes in most cases (more than 90 %). The complexity and heterogeneity of mutations reinforces the need for a comprehensive approach. Because 32 % of the mutations are newly described, we show that a screening strategy based on known mutations would have solved less than 55 % of the cases.
