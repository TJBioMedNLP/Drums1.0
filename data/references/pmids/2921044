A beta-thalassemia mutant caused by a 300-bp deletion in the human beta-globin gene.
Larger deletions are a rare cause of beta-thalassemia. We report a further instance of a deletion comprising about 300 bp in a female heterozygote. Exon 1, part of IVS-1 and the 5' beta-globin gene promotor region are lost.
