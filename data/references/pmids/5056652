Oxygen equilibrium characteristics of abnormal hemoglobins. Hirose (alpha-2-beta-2-37Ser), L Ferrara (alpha-2-47-Gly-beta-2), Broussais (alpha-2-90-Asn-beta-2), and Dhofar (alpha-2-beta-2-58Arg).
The oxygen equilibrium characteristics of four structural variants of hemoglobin A were correlated with their amino acid substitutions. Hemoglobin Dhofar, in which the proline at E2(58)beta is replaced by arginine, had normal oxygen equilibrium characteristics. Hemoglobin L Ferrara. in which the aspartic acid at CD5(47)alpha is replaced by glycine, and hemoglobin Broussais, in which the lysine at FG2(90)alpha is replaced by asparagine, both showed a slightly elevated oxygen affinity; nevertheless both demonstrated a normal heme-heme interaction and a normal Bohr effect. Hemoglobin Hirose, in which the tryptophan at C3 (37)beta is replaced by serine, showed abnormalities of all oxygen equilibrium characteristics; i.e., increased oxygen affinity, diminished heme-heme interaction, and reduced Bohr effect.These results suggest that aspartic acid at CD5(47)alpha and lysine at FG2(90)alpha are involved in the function of the hemoglobin molecule, despite the fact that these positions are not located directly in the heme or the alpha-beta-contact regions. Tryptophan at C3(37)beta is located at contact between alpha(1)- and beta(2)-subunits. It is suggested that the substitution by serine might disturb the quarternary structure of the mutant hemoglobin molecule during transition from oxy-form to deoxy-form resulting in an alteration of the heme function.
