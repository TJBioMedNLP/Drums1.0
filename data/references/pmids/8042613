DNA diagnosis of Hb S and Hb Caribbean (alpha 2 beta 2 91 Leu-->Arg) in a Jamaican family.
We describe a Canadian infant of Jamaican descent who presented with mild anemia. Hb electrophoresis revealed Hb S and an unknown Hb variant that migrated slightly faster than Hb S on cellulose acetate. Molecular studies of the family indicated that the proband is a compound heterozygote for Hb S and Hb Caribbean. Hb Caribbean has previously been characterized as a mildly unstable hemoglobin with low oxygen affinity, due to a Leu-->Arg substitution at amino acid residue 91. The present study establishes the molecular basis for Hb Caribbean (beta 91, CTG-->CGG) and confirms that Hb S/Hb Caribbean syndrome is not associated with serious clinical manifestations.
