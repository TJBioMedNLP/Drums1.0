Hemoglobin Gavello - alpha 2 beta 2 47 (CD6) Asp replaced by Gly. A new hemoglobin variant from Polesine (Italy).
During a survey for abnormal hemoglobins in Polesine (a region north of the Po river, where beta-thalassemia is very frequent) a slow moving variant was noted in a 79-yr-old woman living in Gavello, a small town in the province of Rovigo. Structural studies demonstrated a previously undescribed amino acid substitution, beta47 Asp replaced by Gly. This new variant has been named Hb Gavello.
