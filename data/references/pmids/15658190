Molecular characterization and diagnosis of Hb Crete [beta129(H7)Ala-->Pro].
We report the molecular characterization of Hb Crete [beta129(H7)Ala-->Pro] in a female subject from the Greek island of Crete. DNA sequence analysis revealed a 1368 GCC-->CCC base substitution in exon 3 of the beta-globin gene, leading to the Ala-->Pro amino acid change at codon 129. Both the proband and her mother, who were found to be heterozygotes for Hb Crete, presented with mild microcytic anemia and normal Hb A2 levels and iron metabolism indices. This is the first description of an heterozygous Hb Crete case, and also the first report on the molecular basis of Hb Crete. Moreover, the proposed NlaVI restriction enzyme-based detection of Hb Crete at the DNA level is a fast and accurate approach, useful for molecular diagnostics.
