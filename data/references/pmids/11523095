Identification and characterization by high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of a new variant hemoglobin, Mataro [beta134(H12) Val > Ala.
This work illustrates the practical use of combined microbore reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) in protein identification. The approach consisted of the detection of the abnormal beta-globin chain by ESI-MS analysis of mixtures of intact globins, which simultaneously provided their molecular masses. Separation of the polypeptide globin chains was carried out using microbore C4 RP-HPLC on-line with ESI-MS. Direct peptide-mapping ESI-MS without previous chromatographic separation was performed in order to identify tryptic peptides from whole blood. For the sequence confirmation of the abnormal peptide containing the mutation point, C18 RP-HPLC tryptic separation of the globin mixture on-line with collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation was done. The y series ions allowed the identification of the hemoglobin (Hb) variant as [beta134(H12) Val > Ala]. This new Hb was named Hb Mataro, after the city where it was detected.
