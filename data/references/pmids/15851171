T wave morphology analysis distinguishes between KvLQT1 and HERG mutations in long QT syndrome.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop an objective method to distinguish between HERG and KvLQT1 genotypes on the surface ECG. BACKGROUND: The two most prevalent genes affected in long QT syndrome (LQTS) are KvLQT1 (KCNQ1) and HERG (KCNH2), which are mutated in >90% of patients with a reported LQTS genotype. It is known that T waves have lower amplitude and more notches in HERG patients than T waves in KvLQT1 patients, but this semiquantitative method lacks the discriminative power to be used in a clinical setting. We developed a simple mathematical method that allowed us to quantify T wave shape in LQTS mutations for clinical use. METHODS: ECGs from 24 HERG patients, 13 KvLQT1 LQTS patients, and 13 healthy relatives were examined. The repolarizing integral (RI) was constructed from the T wave. The resulting RI is sigmoid and was modeled using the Hill equation as (RI(t) = V(max)*[t(n)/[K(m)(n) + t(n)]]). V(max) is equivalent to the total T wave area, K(m) is the time when 50% of the T wave area is reached, and n is a measure of the slope of the sigmoid RI. RESULTS: The RI correlated nearly perfectly to the fitted sigmoid, r = 0.99. In lead V(2), V(max) was larger in KvLQT1 (0.148 +/- 0.021) (mean +/- SE) compared to HERG (0.080 +/- 0.012) and controls (0.067 +/- 0.021). The Hill coefficient n of the RI discriminated perfectly between HERG (2.00 +/- 0.11) and KvLQT1 (4.11 +/- 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: RI allows distinguishing between HERG and KvLQT1 mutations based solely on the T wave morphology in the present LQTS population.
