Disseminated Bacille Calmette-Guerin disease as the initial presentation of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency--a case report.
Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination is used to prevent severe M. tuberculosis infection. It has been used in many countries for a long time. However, complications do occur, including localized abscesses, regional lymphadenitis and disseminated disease. The latter is often associated with underlying immunodeficiency. We report an 8-month-old male infant presenting with cough and fever who had had a generalized pigmented skin rash for one month. Skin biopsy revealed mycobacterial infection, but his response to treatment was poor and he had a persistent mild fever. Immunological studies revealed an IgG of 49 mg/dl, IgA 4 mg/dl, IgM 28 mg/dl, IgE < 1 mg/dl, CD3 1.1%, CD4 0.6%, CD8 0.6%, CD19 93.9%, CD57 1.1%, activated T cells 0.9%, and CH50 < 6.3%. These findings are compatible with the diagnosis of T(-)B(+)NK- severe combined immunodeficiency. Sequence analysis was performed and showed the presence of missense mutation in IL2Rgamma gene. An X-linked recessive inheritance pattern was proved by sequence analysis of his mother and grandmother. In order to identify the strain of the microorganism, we reviewed pathology of the skin biopsy which consisted of diffuse histiocytic infiltrate with poorly formed granulomas and no necrosis and used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the stain-positive clinical specimen and verify the organism found in the child's biopsy as M. bovis BCG strain. The diagnosis of disseminated BCG disease must be considered in any infant with cutaneous mycobacterial lesions, especially with atypical histologic findings. Such a patient's immunologic status should be evaluated and further family study is suggested. A high index of suspicion is needed to make a timely diagnosis, as early intervention with intensive treatment and bone marrow transplantation may be life-saving.
