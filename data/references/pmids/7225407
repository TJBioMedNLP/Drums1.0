Hemoglobin bologna (alpha 2 beta 2 61 (E5) lys replaced by met). An abnormal human hemoglobin with low oxygen affinity.
An abnormal human hemoglobin was found in association with beta-thalassemia in a hemolysate from an 11-year-old healthy child living in Bologna (northern Italy). Structural studies demonstrated a previously unreported amino acid substitution, beta 61 (E5) Lys replaced by Met (this is an external residue). The new variant has been named Hb Bologna, and is characterized by a reduced oxygen affinity. Family studies indicated that the variant had been inherited from the father, a 41-year-old male of Southern Italian origin. Also, a brother of the propositus was found to be an abnormal Hb carrier.
