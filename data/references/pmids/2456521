Molecular characterization of a novel form of (A gamma delta beta)zero-thalassemia deletion with a 3' breakpoint close to those of HPFH-3 and HPFH-4: insights for a common regulatory mechanism.
We have molecularly characterized a novel (A gamma delta beta)zero-thalassemia associated with increased synthesis of HbF in three members of a German family. The levels of HbF in the peripheral blood red cells of the heterozygotes ranged between 9.9% and 12.5% with a heterocellular distribution in the red cells, as detected by immunofluorescence. The mutation resulted from a deletion starting about 1.5 to 1.9 kb from the 3' end of the G gamma-gene and ending 27 +/- 0.5 kb 3' to the beta-globin gene. Thus, the total deletion is 52 +/- 0.5 kb. Its 5' breakpoint is similar to that of the previously described (A gamma delta beta)zero-thalassemias, while the location of the 3' breakpoint is placed very close to the 3' breakpoints of HPFH-4 and HPFH-3 deletions. The proximity of the 3' breakpoint of the German (A gamma delta beta)zero-thalassemia to those of HPFH-3 and HPFH-4 deletions raises the possibility that a common mechanism, such as the juxtaposition of an enhancer, might underlie the activation of the gamma-globin genes in these three mutants.
