Osteogenesis imperfecta with congenital joint contractures (Bruck syndrome).
Five children from three unrelated families were born with symmetrical contractures of the knees, ankles and feet. An initial diagnosis of arthrogryposis multiplex was made, but frequent fracturing occurred after walking commenced and it was then recognised that the children had osteogenesis imperfecta. The pathogenesis of the congenital contractures is unknown, but the symmetry and lack of evidence of prior fracturing is suggestive of articular immobility during early intra-uterine development. The consistency of the anatomical distribution of the contractures, in the setting of a uniform OI phenotype, is suggestive of syndromic identity. A similar case was documented by Alfred Bruck in 1897 and we propose that the eponymous designation "Bruck syndrome" should be applied to the disorder.
