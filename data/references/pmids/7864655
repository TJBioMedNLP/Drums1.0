Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VII: phenotype and genotype.
A patient suffering from a severe form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is presented (EDS type VII). The presence of bilateral congenital hip dislocation, generalized joint hypermobility and a soft hyperelastic skin with abnormal scarring suggested a specific collagen type I defect. SDS-PAGE analysis of collagens secreted into the medium of fibroblast cultures showed a retarded migration of more than half of the alpha 2(I) chains. CNBr peptide mapping of the HPLC-purified altered chain localized the mutant locus to the N-terminal region of the protein. cDNA analysis of the corresponding gene COL1A2 revealed, in addition to the expected collagen sequence, a transcript missing the entire exon 6. This exon encodes a major crosslinking site within collagen fibres as well as the N-propeptidase cleavage site. The skipping of exon 6 is caused by a splice site mutation substituting an A for a G at the first nucleotide of intron 6.
