Hemoglobin Tilburg: alpha 2-beta 2 73 (E 17) Asp----Gly. A new hemoglobin with reduced oxygen affinity.
A new hemoglobin variant has been found in a Dutch Caucasian girl and detected also in members of three generations of her family. This variant is characterized by the substitution of an aspartic acid at position 73 (E 17) of the beta-chain with a glycine residue. Hemoglobin Tilburg makes up to 42% of the total hemoglobin in the blood of the proposita, it is stable at the isopropanol test, and not associated with significant hematological abnormalities in heterozygous carriers. The oxygen dissociation curve of the purified variant, carried out at different pH values, shows a definite reduction of the affinity for oxygen and a normal alkaline Bohr effect. Three more hemoglobins with a single amino acid substitution at the same site have been previously described: Hb Korle-Bu (Asp----Asn), Hb Mobile (Asp----Val) and Hb Vancouver (Asp----Tyr). In all these proteins the affinity for oxygen is lowered to an extent which is variable and characteristic of each mutant. In this paper we discuss the possible mechanism responsible for the abnormal behaviour of hemoglobins substituted at beta 73.
