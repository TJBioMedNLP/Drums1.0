[A case of enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome with PDS gene mutations].
Enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) is an inner ear anomaly occasionally associated with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and/or dizziness. Recent genetic studies indicate that mutations in the PDS gene may cause EVA. A 10-year-old EVA patient who had undergone annual hearing tests for 7 years had an aunt and cousin who also had hearing loss and EVA, so genetic examinations were conducted for a possible genetic link. Two new PDS gene mutations, S610X and S657N, were found in all 3, including the proband. We discuss the importance of genetic analysis, which offers new insight into SNHL diagnosis and treatment in children.
