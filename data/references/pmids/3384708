Hb Las Palmas or alpha 2 beta 2(49)(CD8)Ser----Phe, a mildly unstable hemoglobin variant.
A new hemoglobin variant with a Ser----Phe substitution at position beta 49(CD8) was discovered in two members of a family living in the Canary Islands, Spain. Detection was by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. The variant, which constituted 43% and 45%, respectively, in the two heterozygotes, was slightly unstable. Its presence did not affect hematological values though there was a mild reticulocytosis.
