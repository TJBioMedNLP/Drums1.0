Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase Lodi844C: a study on its expression in blood cells and muscle.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency was found in erythrocytes, lymphocytes and muscle of an Italian male, whose family has lived for at least three generations in Lodi (Lombardy, northern Italy). The subject was hospitalized for myalgia and dark urine after intense physical exercise, but no sign of anemia and chronic hemolysis were present at rest. Family studies revealed that the mother and the maternal aunt had the same enzymopathy. The enzyme-specific activity in red blood cells was 15% of control and the kinetic properties were the following: slower electrophoretic mobility; biphasic pH activity curve; slightly reduced thermal stability, and increased utilization of the substrate analogs. The analysis of our patient's DNA showed a G----C mutation at nucleotide 844 which causes an Asp----His amino acid change in position 282. This is the same mutation found by De Vita et al. in the G6PD Seattle-like variant. However, by following a new convention, we labelled our variant as G6PD Lodi844C. As far as the muscle is concerned, we found that the enzyme-specific activity in this tissue was 14% of control values, but cultured myotubes and myoblasts revealed a normal level of G6PD as well as skin fibroblasts. On the contrary in the same type of cultured cells obtained from G6PD Mediterranean subjects, the G6PD activity was about 20% of normal. Our results complete the characterization of this mutant enzyme, demonstrate the expression of the deficit in muscle and describe the enzyme behaviour in cultured cells.
