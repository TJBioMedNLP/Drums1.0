Identification of two novel mutations in the hypoglycemic phenotype of very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.
Very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) catalyzes the initial step of long chain fatty acid oxidation in the mitochondria. Patients with VLCAD deficiency have recently been observed with two clinical phenotypes. The cardiac form presents with an early onset cardiomyopathy and a high incidence of infant death, while the hypoglycemic form resembles medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) manifesting with hypoketotic hypoglycemia. In our investigation on the molecular basis for these phenotypes, we identified two novel mutations in one VLCAD patient with the hypoglycemic form, a C953T (Pro318Leu) mutation in exon 10 resulting in a substitution of proline 318 by leucine on one allele, and a C1194A (Tyr398Stop) mutation in exon 12 which created a premature stop codon TAA on another allele. The Tyr398Stop mutation may result in a truncated protein or instable messenger RNA.
