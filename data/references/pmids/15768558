Two new hemoglobin variants: Hb Brem-sur-Mer [beta9(A6)Ser-->Tyr] and Hb Passy [alpha81(F2)Ser-->Pro (alpha2)].
Two new hemoglobin (Hb) variants: Hb Brem-sur-Mer [codon 9 (TCT-->TAT); beta9(A6)Ser-->Tyr] on the first exon of the beta-globin gene and Hb Passy [codon 81 (TCC-->CCC); alpha81(F2)Ser-->Pro (alpha2)] on the second exon of the alpha2-globin gene, are described. The two variants were characterized by DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry (MS). Hematological abnormalities: microcytosis and hypochromia were found only in the carrier of Hb Passy. In the absence of an association with an alpha-thalassemic deletion or mutation, the mutation 81(F2)Pro could induce a possible alpha-thalassemia (thal).
