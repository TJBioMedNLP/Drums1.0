Two new human hemoglobin variants caused by unusual mutational events: Hb Zaire contains a five residue repetition within the alpha-chain and Hb Duino has two residues substituted in the beta-chain.
With rare exceptions, the more than 600 human hemoglobin variants described are caused by a single point mutation. Other abnormal features, such as unequal crossing-over, frameshift mutagenesis or double mutations in the same polypeptide chain, have seldom been encountered. We report two new variants caused by such rare mutational events. Hb Zaire [alpha 116(GH4)-His-Leu-Pro-Ala-Glu-117 (GH5)] is the second example in which a short amino acid sequence is inserted within the alpha-chain. This abnormal hemoglobin results from a tandem repetition of 5 amino-acid residues, from sequence 112 through 116, at the end of the GH corner. Hb Duino is an unstable hemoglobin. It presents within the same beta-chain, the association of two rare point mutations; these substitutions are those found in Hb Newcastle [beta 92(F8)His----Pro] and in Hb Camperdown [beta 104(G6)Arg----Ser]. Family studies demonstrated that the Hb Newcastle abnormality was a de novo mutation of a gene already carrying the Hb Camperdown substitution.
