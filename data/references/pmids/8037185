Beta-thalassemia alleles and unstable hemoglobin types among Russian pediatric patients.
A recently initiated collaboration between Russian and American institutions has resulted in the characterization of several known or new beta-thalassemia alleles and unstable hemoglobin types. Nine known beta-thalassemia alleles were present which have also been found in Mediterranean, East Asian, and Black populations; the possibility of independent mutations for some of the rare alleles should be considered. Hb Durham-N.C./Brescia with a codon 114 (CTG-->CCG; Leu-->Pro) change was present in six members of two families. This condition and two new variants have the characteristics of a dominant type of beta-thalassemia heterozygosity with moderate anemia, Heinz body formation, splenomegaly, etc. One new beta-thalassemia allele is a frame-shift at codon 124 (-A), while another is characterized by the introduction of an extra proline residue (codon: CCA) between residues Thr (beta 123) and Val (beta 126) to give the sequence -Thr-Pro-Pro-Pro-Val-.
