beta-Thalassemia due to a deletion of the nucleotide which is substituted in the beta S-globin gene.
Sickle-cell anemia results from an A leads to T transversion in the second nucleotide of codon 6 of the beta-globin gene. We now report an uncommon beta-thalassemia gene that contains a deletion of this nucleotide. Thus, one mutation (GAG leads to GTG) produces sickle-cell anemia, while the other (GAG leads to GG) eliminates beta-globin production. These data establish that different alterations affecting one specific nucleotide can produce either an abnormal hemoglobin or beta-thalassemia. Moreover, the nucleotide sequence comprising codons 6-8 of the beta-globin gene appears to be particularly susceptible to mutations affecting nucleotide number.
