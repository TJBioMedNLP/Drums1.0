Mutations of the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP): hotspots, effect on transcription, and translation and phenotype/genotype correlation.
The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked recessive immune deficiency disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, small platelet size, eczema, recurrent infections, and increased risk of autoimmune disorders and malignancies. X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT) is an allelic variant of WAS which presents with a milder phenotype, generally limited to thrombocytopenia. WAS and XLT are caused by mutations of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) gene which encodes a 502-amino acid protein, named WASP. WASP is thought to play a role in actin cytoskeleton organization and cell signaling. Here, we report the identification of 141 unique mutations, 71 not previously reported, from 227 WAS/XLT families with a total of 262 affected members. When possible we studied the effects of these mutations on transcription, RNA splicing, and protein expression. By analyzing a large number of patients with WAS/XLT at the molecular level we identified 5 mutational hotspots in the WASP gene and have been able to establish a strong association between genotype and phenotype.
