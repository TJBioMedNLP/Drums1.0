Angiotensin synthesis in the brain and increased turnover in hypertensive rats.
The missing link in the evidence for an active endogenous renin angiotensin system in the brain has been the demonstration of local angiotensin synthesis in the central nervous system in vivo. In this report the extraction and characterization of angiotensin I and angiotensin II from the brain of rats is described. The accumulation of angiotensin I was enhanced in hypertensive rats when the conversion to angiotensin II was blocked in vivo by the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril.
