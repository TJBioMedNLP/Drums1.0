Rieger's anomaly and other ocular abnormalities in association with osteogenesis imperfecta and a COL1A1 mutation.
A patient with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and some features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome had Rieger's anomaly and other associated ocular abnormalities. He carried a COL1A1 mutation (c.3313delA) that has only rarely been seen in OI. The association of ocular anterior chamber abnormalities with OI has not been reported previously, while OI with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome features has only been described in some kindreds. The patient had serious complications as a result of his ocular anomalies. We speculate that the course of his disease and, perhaps, its co-existence with OI could be exacerbated by his collagen type-I defect, although no causality can be established by this report of a single case.
