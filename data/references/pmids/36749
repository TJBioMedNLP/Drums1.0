Comparison of hemoglobins Wood (alpha 2 beta 2 97 leu) and Malmo (alpha 2 beta 2 97 gln). Diagnostic value of citrate agar electrophoresis.
Diagnostic value of citrate agar electrophoresis. Am J Clin Pathol 71:668-671, 1979. Of approximately three dozen hemoglobin variants that have greater than usual oxygen affinity, nearly half are inseparable from hemoglobin A by electrophoresis at pH 8.6. A comparison of hemoglobins Wood (alpha2beta297leu) and Malmo (alpha2beta297gln) is of interest from several standpoints. They represent similar substitutions at the identical locus in the beta chain. They result in identical clinical and hematologic manifestations. Oxygen affinities of these variants are identical. Both are poorly resolved from hemoglobin A by electrophoresis at pH 8.6. The position of each is identical when studied by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel. Finally, they are easily distinguished by citrate agar electrophoresis at pH 6.2. The excellent resolution of hemoglobins Malmo and Wood from each other results neither from difference in charge, nor size, nor in quaternary structure. This technic provides a simple but effective means for identifying and differentiating these hemoglobin variants. Comparison with the results of citrate agar electrophoresis of other high oxygen-affinity hemoglobins indicates that the findings for hemoglobins Malmo and Wood are unique and unambiguous.
