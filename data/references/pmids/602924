Hb Leiden-beta (0) thalassemia in a Chinese with severe hemolytic anemia.
The first case of Hb Leiden (alpha2beta2 6 or 7 Glu---O)-beta (0) thalassemia in a young patient with chronic severe hemolytic anemia, which improved after splenectomy, is described. His parents were Chinese. The patient's blood showed no Hb A or normal beta chains when no blood transfusion was given. His mother was heterozygous for beta(0) thalassemia, and his father and brother had a trait for the unstable Hb Leiden. The Hb Leiden level of the father was 22.6% and that of the brother was 19.3%. It is probable that the abnormal hemoglobin in this Chinese family resulted from an independent gene mutation, unrelated to the one found in 2 Caucasian families reported earlier.
