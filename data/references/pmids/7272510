Hemoglobin Great Lakes (beta 68 [E12] leucine replaced by histidine): a new high-affinity hemoglobin.
Hemoglobin Great Lakes, beta 68 (E12) Leu replaced by His is a new high oxygen affinity hemoglobin variant discovered in a 29-yr-old female having numerous hospitalizations for thrombophlebitis associated with mild erythrocytosis. The mutant hemoglobin has normal stability and normal electrophoretic mobility, but increased oxygen affinity (P-50 16.1 mm Hg at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4) and reduced cooperativity. The abnormal beta-chain could be separated on globin chain chromatography on carboxymethyl/cellulose in spite of the normal electrophoretic mobility of the intact hemoglobin. The leucyl residue at beta 68th position (E12) is in the middle of E-helix, which is part of the heme pocket and next to the valine (E11), which is the heme binding site. The substitution of proline for leucine in hemoglobin Mizuho resulted in the distortion of tertiary structure of the beta-chains and lead to a serious instability of hemoglobin molecule. However, the substitution of this residue by histidine in hemoglobin Great Lakes is not associated with hemoglobin instability.
