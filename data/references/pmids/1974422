Molecular basis of HbE-beta-thalassemia and the origin of HbE in northeast Thailand: identification of one novel mutation using amplified DNA from buffy coat specimens.
Amplification of DNA via polymerase chain reaction directly from a small amount of a buffy coat fraction was used to study the molecular basis of HbE-beta-thalassemia in the northeastern Thai population. Eight different mutations including the new one causing a beta o-thalassemia phenotype were detected. This novel mutation is an amber mutation at codon 26, which occurs at the same position as that of HbE; the most common hemoglobin variant in Southeast Asian countries. A pitfall in detection of the HbE mutation by restriction enzyme analysis was pointed out and differential diagnosis of the HbE mutation and the novel one by using allele specific oligonucleotide probes were described. Analysis of polymorphic restriction sites in the beta-globin gene cluster containing the beta E gene revealed two previously undescribed haplotypes in the Southeast Asian populations, which provide evidence for the multiple origins of beta E gene in Southeast Asian populations.
