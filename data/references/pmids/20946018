Lethal/ Severe Osteogenesis Imperfecta in a Large Family: A Novel Homozygous LEPRE1 Mutation and Bone Histological Findings.
Abstract We report a large consanguineous Turkish family in which multiple individuals are affected with autosomal recessive lethal or severe osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) due to a novel homozygous LEPRE1 mutation. In one affected individual histological studies of bone tissue were performed, which indicates that the histology of LEPRE1 associated OI is indistinguishable from COL1A1/2, CRTAP and PPIB related OI.
