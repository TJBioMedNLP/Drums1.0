Structural study of hemoglobin Hazebrouck, beta 38(C4)Thr----Pro. A new abnormal hemoglobin with instability and low oxygen affinity.
A new beta-variant has been detected and structurally defined in a French male, with a life-long history of hemolytic anemia. This variant is moderately unstable and has a low oxygen affinity. The abnormal hemoglobin was not detected by standard electrophoretic procedures. It moved slightly slower than Hb A during isoelectric focusing (IEF). Two minor fractions were also seen; the first migrated just cathodal to Hb F, as did partially oxidized Hb A or hemichrome derivatives of some unstable hemoglobins; the second in the position of free alpha-chains. The abnormal beta-chain was readily separated from both beta A- and alpha A-chains by acid-urea-Triton globin chain electrophoresis. Structural study was conducted simultaneously by fingerprinting and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of tryptic peptides. A new mutation beta 38(C4)Thr----Pro was found, which was named Hb Hazebrouck.
