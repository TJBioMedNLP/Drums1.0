Hb E/Hb LeporeHollandia in a family from Bangladesh.
We describe a family from Bangladesh in which three children are compound heterozygotes for Hb E (alpha 2 beta 2, beta 26Glu Lys) and Hb Lepore (delta-beta fusion gene). PCR amplification and direct nucleotide sequencing established that the fusion gene is Hb LeporeHollandia, with the cross-over localized to a 40 bp window between codon 22 and IVS-1 nt 16 of the delta- and beta-globin genes. This unusual combination of mutations is associated with a relatively mild clinical phenotype, with all three affected siblings having microcytic anemia of moderate severity without the need for transfusions.
