Gene sequencing in neonates and infants with the long QT syndrome.
The objective was to analyze the clinical and molecular findings in a cohort of neonates and infants with the autosomal dominant long QT syndrome (LQTS). Those affected face a high risk of ventricular arrhythmia resulting in syncope, seizure or sudden death. Blood samples submitted for molecular diagnostic studies on 7 infants were subject to DNA extraction and mutation analysis of 18 selected exons in 5 LQTS genes (KCNQ1, HERG, SCN5A, KCNE1, and KCNE2). We detected 11 mutations in these 7 patients. Four patients had 2 mutations in 1 gene (compound heterozygotes) or 2 different genes (digenic inheritance), while 3 patients had 1 mutation each. Except for 1 mutation in KCNE1, all other mutations were detected alone or in combination within HERG and the SCN5A genes. Four of the mutations we found are novel. The lethal nature of the LQTS demands careful attention to the family history and prompt and precise diagnosis and treatment with serious consideration of endocardial pacemaker implantation. While much larger studies are needed, our data suggest that compound heterozygotes or those with 2 mutations in different genes are likely to have a more severe LQTS including early manifestations in neonates and infants.
