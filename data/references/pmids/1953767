Two commonly occurring nucleotide base substitutions in Chinese G6PD variants.
Using a direct PCR sequencing technique, we have identified two DNA base substitutions in 8 different biochemical G6PD variants of Chinese origin. Neither one of these abnormalities has been reported in other ethnic groups. An abnormality (C1) of G to T substitution at cDNA 1376 causing an amino acid change from Arg to Leu has been found in 3 variants. Another abnormality (C2) of G to A substitution at cDNA 1388 causing an amino acid change from Arg to His has been found in 5 variants. Both C1 and C2 are located in exon 12 of the G6PD gene and are only 12 base pairs apart. However, C1 is associated with a significant increase in the deamino-NADP utilization rate, whereas C2 is not. Taken together, our data suggest that C1 and C2 are very common among Chinese with a G6PD deficiency and exon 12 may define an important functional domain of the human G6PD.
