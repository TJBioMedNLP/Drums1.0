Promoter mutations producing mild beta-thalassaemia in the Italian population.
In this study we have investigated the molecular basis for a mild form of beta-thalassaemia in three patients of Italian descent. In two, belonging to different families and affected by a mild and late-presenting form of thalassaemia major, direct sequencing of amplified DNA detected a C----T substitution at position -87 of the beta-globin gene in the compound heterozygous state either with codon 39 nonsense mutation or beta +IVSI, nt 110 mutation. The -87 (C----T) mutation has been previously described, in combination with the beta +IVSI, nt 110 mutation, in a single patient with thalassaemia intermedia. Both our patients showed a more severe phenotype as compared to that resulting from compound heterozygosity for a severe beta-thalassaemia mutation and another promoter mutation (-87, C----G) at the same position. In the third patient with the thalassaemia intermedia phenotype, we detected a novel promoter mutation, consisting in a C----A substitution at position -86, in combination with the codon 39 nonsense mutation. The results of this study indicate that different nucleotide substitutions affecting the proximal CACCC box of the beta-globin gene in combination with severe beta-thalassaemia, produce a mild form of thalassaemia ranging in severity from thalassaemia intermedia to late-presenting thalassaemia major.
