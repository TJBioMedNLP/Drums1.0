Heterogeneity of DNA deletion in gamma delta beta-thalassemia.
By restriction endonuclease mapping, gene cloning, and DNA sequencing we have determined the region of DNA that is deleted in a family with gamma delta beta-thalassemia. The deletion removes the linked epsilon, gamma-, and delta-globin structural genes and terminates within the coding portion of the beta-globin gene. Since the extent of DNA deletion in this family differs from that reported in another family, we conclude that gamma delta beta-thalassemia is heterogeneous at the molecular level.
