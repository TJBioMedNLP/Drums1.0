MECP2 gene analysis in classical Rett syndrome and in patients with Rett-like features.
OBJECTIVE: To discuss the diagnostic criteria for Rett syndrome based on mutational screening of the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene ( MECP2 ) in patients with classic Rett syndrome and patients with Rett-like features. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with classical Rett syndrome, one with preserved speech variant (PSV), and 12 patients with developmental delay and some features of Rett syndrome were recruited for sequence analysis of the MECP2 gene coding region. The phenotype of the patients was correlated with the presence and type of the mutation as well as the X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern. RESULTS: found in 100% of the patients with classical Rett syndrome originating from Finland. One novel mutation, P127L, was detected in a patient with PSV. No mutations were found in other cases. The XCI status was found to be random in 72% of the patients with classical Rett syndrome, including the patient with PSV and all patients with developmental delay informative for the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: An MECP2 mutation can be found in almost every patient with classical Rett syndrome. More patients need to be analyzed in order to clarify the mutation prevalence in patients with atypical Rett syndrome and in patients with mental retardation.
