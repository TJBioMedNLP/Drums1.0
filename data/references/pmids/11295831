Identification of novel WFS1 mutations in Italian children with Wolfram syndrome.
Six unrelated Italian children with Wolfram syndrome (WS) were analyzed for mutations in the WFS1. Four novel mutations (1387delCTCT, S443I, 1519del16, and IVS6+16g->a) were identified. In addition, we found two new, probably neutral changes (A684V and R708C). Other previously described variants were a heterozygous I333V in three alleles and the H611R in two. The 1519del16 mutation was carried by two patients whereas the CTCT deletion occurred in three subjects from two apparently unrelated families with WS. The current study expands the spectrum of mutations in WFS1 and represents the first molecular characterization of Italian WS patients.
