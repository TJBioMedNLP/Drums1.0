Origin heterogeneity of Hb Lepore-Boston gene in Italy.
Forty-three hybrid delta-beta-globin genes were characterized by DNA sequence analysis and associated RFLP haplotypes in 40 families from Abruzzo and Campania, which are on the east and west coast of Italy, respectively. All the genes had the delta-globin sequence up to the exon 2 codon 87 and had the beta-globin sequence from IVS-2-8; between these two ends, they had 58 bp in common with the delta- and beta-globin genes. Thus, they were all of the Lepore-Boston type. A chromosomal background heterogeneity was present among the mutant genes. In fact, they were all associated with (+ - - - -) 5' subhaplotype, but 23/31 from Campania were associated with (+ +) 3' subhaplotype, whereas 12/12 genes from Abruzzo and 8/31 from Campania were associated with (+ -). DNA sequencing of homozygous subjects showed that (+ +) 3' subhaplotype was associated, at IVS-2-74, with G, while (+ -) was associated with T; that is they were associated with the beta-globin gene sequence of frameworks 1 and 2, respectively. The molecular characteristics of this heterogeneity, as well as its geographical patterns in the eastern and western regions of Italy, represent strong evidence for the recurrent and multicentric origins of the mutation.
