Mutations in the gene for the common gamma chain (gammac) in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency.
X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) constitutes a disorder of the immune system caused by mutations in the gene encoding the common gamma chain (gammac), a subunit of the IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15 receptors, which are necessary for lymphocyte development and function. In this study the IL2RG gene of 31 patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) was examined by nonradioactive single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis. Among the 11 patients with XSCID, ten different mutations were identified in the IL2RG gene, including eight novel mutations. Ninety percent of the mothers of the XSCID patients are carriers of the mutated allele. One patient showed low numbers of B-cells, a striking deviation from the classical B-cell-positive and T-cell-negative phenotype.
