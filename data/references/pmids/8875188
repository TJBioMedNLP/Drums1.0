Fabry disease: fourteen alpha-galactosidase A mutations in unrelated families from the United Kingdom and other European countries.
The nature of the molecular lesions in the alpha-galactosidase A gene causing Fabry disease in 12 unrelated families from the United Kingdom and 4 from other European countries was determined in order to provide precise heterozygote detection and prenatal diagnosis for these families. The entire alpha-galactosidase A coding region and flanking intronic sequences were analyzed by amplification of genomic DNA and solid-phase direct sequencing or by SSCP analysis followed by solid-phase direct sequencing. Fourteen new mutations were identified including 10 missense mutations (M42V, R49S, C56Y, D92H, D93G, P205T, W236C, W287G, N298H, and W340R), 2 nonsense mutations (Q107X and Q119X) and 2 small deletions (257del18 and 1087del1). Together with the previously reported mutations, a total of 33 lesions in the alpha-galactosidase A gene have been identified in unrelated British families, further documenting the molecular genetic heterogeneity of this disease.
