Mutation in the S3 segment of KCNQ1 results in familial lone atrial fibrillation.
BACKGROUND: Mutations in several ion channel genes have been reported to cause rare cases of familial atrial fibrillation (AF). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the genetic basis for AF in a family with autosomal dominant AF. METHODS: Family members were evaluated by 12-lead ECG, echocardiogram, signal-averaged P-wave analysis, and laboratory studies. Fourteen family members in AF-324 were studied. Six individuals had AF, with a mean age at onset of 32 years (range 16-59 years). RESULTS: Compared with unaffected family members, those with AF had a longer mean QRS duration (100 vs 86 ms, P = .015) but no difference in the corrected QT interval (423 +/- 15 ms vs 421 +/- 21 ms). The known loci for AF and other cardiovascular diseases were evaluated. Evidence of linkage was obtained with marker D11S4088 located within KCNQ1, and a highly conserved serine in the third transmembrane region was found to be mutated to a proline (S209P). Compared to the wild-type channel, the S209P mutant activates more rapidly, deactivates more slowly, and has a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage activation curve. A fraction of the mutant channels are constitutively open at all voltages, resulting in a net increase in I(Ks) current. CONCLUSION: We identified a family with lone AF due to a mutation in the highly conserved S3 domain of KCNQ1, a region of the channel not previously implicated in the pathogenesis of AF.
