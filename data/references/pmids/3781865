A case of hemoglobin Indianapolis [beta 112(G14) Cys----Arg] in an individual from Cordoba, Spain.
Hemoglobin Indianapolis was first described by Adams et al (1,2) as a very unstable variant with a phenotype similar to severe beta-thalassemia. We have also characterized this variant, but there are several differences in the clinical expression of the variant described in our report and those described in the original case. We found Hb Indianapolis to be unstable, but not to the extent that it could not be detected by routine testing. The four family members heterozygous for the variant were not anemic, showed normal hematologic values, and did not exhibit any severe clinical disadvantages, although there was slight reticulocytosis. The variant could not be resolved from Hb A on cellulose acetate (pH 8.4), but isoelectric focusing showed a double band in the region of Hb A that is probably the variant and Hb A. However, the variant chain was clearly evident by globin chain analyses in acid and alkaline buffers. The condition of additional blood samples did not allow us to determine the oxygen dissociation properties of the variant or the rates of globin chain synthesis.
