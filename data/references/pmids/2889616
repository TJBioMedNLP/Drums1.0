Different molecular defects of G gamma (A gamma delta beta)o-thalassaemia in Thailand.
DNA from members of 2 Thai families with conditions considered to be delta beta-thalassaemia were studied by using restriction endonuclease DNA mapping. The propositus in family A is a double heterozygote for beta-thalassaemia and delta beta-thalassaemia. DNA analysis reveals a deletion of the beta-globin gene cluster starting at the area between the Sac I and Eco RI sites near the 3' end of the G gamma-gene and extending through the A gamma-, delta- and beta-genes to an unknown extent downstream. In family B, the propositus is delta beta-thalassaemia/Hb E. Deletion of the beta-globin gene cluster begins in the large intervening sequence of the A gamma-gene and removes both delta- and beta-genes downstream.
