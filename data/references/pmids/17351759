Clinical follow-up of 11 Argentinian CD40L-deficient patients with 7 unique mutations including the so-called "milder" mutants.
CD40 ligand (CD40L) deficiency is an X-linked combined immunodeficiency characterized by impaired class switch recombination. We analyzed clinical and molecular findings in 11 Argentinian patients from seven unrelated families. The mean age at onset of symptoms was 1.1 years (0.5-3.0 years) and the 10 alive patients have a median age of 17 years. We identified two nonsense mutations, including R11X reported as a "hypomorphic" defect, four missense mutations, and one point deletion. Although R11X was associated herein with parvovirus B19-anemia and higher Igs levels as previously described, histoplasmosis and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia were also present. Other so-called "milder" mutation, T254M, was present in three related patients clinically and immunologically undistinguishable from the rest of the cohort. Furthermore, 10 of the 11 patients, having heterogeneous mutations, never had persistent neutropenia, none presented Cryptosporidium sp. infection nor developed liver-biliary tract disease, highlighting the debatable concept of "milder" mutations.
