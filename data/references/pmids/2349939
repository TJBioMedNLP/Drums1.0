Inheritance of an RNA splicing mutation (G+ 1 IVS20) in the type III procollagen gene (COL3A1) in a family having aortic aneurysms and easy bruisability: phenotypic overlap between familial arterial aneurysms and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV.
Inheritance of a single base mutation in the type III procollagen gene (COL3A1) was studied in a family with aortic aneurysms and easy bruisability. The mutation was a substitution of A for G+ 1 of intron 20 of the gene and caused aberrant splicing of RNA transcribed from the mutated allele. The phenotype in the family included aortic aneurysms that ruptured and produced death. It also included easy bruisability, but it did not include other characteristic features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, such as ecchymoses, abnormal scarring, or prominent subcutaneous blood vessels. The data from the family, together with a review of other probands with mutations in the type III procollagen gene, indicated that there is phenotypic overlap between Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV and familial arterial aneurysms not associated with any overlap between Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV and familial arterial aneurysms not associated with any of the striking changes in skin originally cited as a characteristic feature of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. In addition, the results suggested that DNA tests for mutations in the type III procollagen gene may be useful to identify individuals predisposed to developing arterial aneurysms.
