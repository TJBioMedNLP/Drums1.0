Gaucher disease in Colombia: mutation identification and comparison to other Hispanic populations.
Gaucher disease is the most common of the lysosomal storage disorders, affecting all ethnic groups. The pathology of this recessively inherited disease arises from the accumulation of glucocerebroside in tissues due to deficient activity of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (E.C. 3.2.1.45). The glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene spans a 7.2kb fragment located on locus 1q 21, consisting of 11 exons and 10 introns. Located 16 kb downstream is a highly homologous pseudogene sequence [M. Horowitz, S. Wilder, Z. Horowitz, O. Reiner, T. Gelbart, E. Beutler, The Human Glucocerebrosidase gene and pseudogene: structure and evolution. Genomics 4 (1) (1989) 87-96.]. Fourteen fragments comprising 11 exons of the GBA gene were analyzed in DNA samples from 25 Colombian patients using denaturing High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC). Sequencing of abnormal findings led to the discovery of three novel mutations (c.595_596 delCT, c.898 delG and c.1,255 G>C [p.D 419 H] in exons 6, 7, and 9 of the GBA gene) with high prevalence among Colombian patients. We have also found the presence of a double mutation p.L 483 P+p.E 355 K (L 444 P+E 326 K, traditional nomenclature) in two different families classified as Gaucher type 1. This mutation was previously reported in one patient with Gaucher type 2. We have found DHPLC to be a reliable and sensitive method for the detection of mutations and allelic variation in Gaucher patients.
