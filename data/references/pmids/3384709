Hemoglobin Pierre-Benite [beta 90(F6)Glu----Asp], a new high affinity variant found in a French family.
Hemoglobin Pierre-Benite [beta 90(F6)Glu---Asp] is a new high affinity variant (P50 = 21.5 mm Hg), with normal heme-heme interaction, found in a French family. It was difficult to detect by conventional electrophoretic methods. However, the high performance liquid chromatography profile of its tryptic peptides contained an additional peak. Amino acid analysis of the corresponding peptide and determination of its sequence allowed us to identify the mutation. No instability was found. Mutations previously recorded in position 90 of the beta-chain display a positive charge shift and a reduced affinity for oxygen, whereas Hb Pierre-Benite shows no charge shift and increased affinity for oxygen.
