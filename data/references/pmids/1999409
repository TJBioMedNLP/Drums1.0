DNA sequence abnormalities of human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants.
Over 400 supposedly biochemically and genetically distinct variants of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) have been described in the past. In order to investigate these variants at the DNA sequence level we have now determined the relevant sequences of introns of G6PD and describe a method which allows us to rapidly determine the sequence of the entire coding region of G6PD. This technique was applied to six variants that cause G6PD deficiency to be functionally so severe as to result in nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Although the patients were all unrelated, G6PD Marion, Gastonia, and Minnesota each had identical mutations, a G----T at nucleotide (nt) 637 in exon 6 leading to a Val----Leu substitution at amino acid 213. The mutations of Nashville and Anaheim were identical to each other, viz. G----A at nt 1178 in exon 10 producing a Arg----His substitution at amino acid 393. G6PD Loma Linda had a C----A substitution at nt 1089 in exon 10, producing a Asn----Lys change at amino acid 363. The results confirm our earlier results suggesting that the NADP-binding site is in a small region of exon 10 and suggest the possibility that this area is also concerned with the binding of glucose-6-P.
