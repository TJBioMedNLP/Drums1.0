The G----A mutation at position +22 3' to the Cap site of the beta-globin gene as a possible cause for a beta-thalassemia.
We describe the occurrence of a chromosome with a G----A mutation at position +22 relative to the Cap site that was found in five patients with beta-thalassemia. All patients had a common type of beta-thalassemia mutation on the second chromosome, namely the frameshift at codon 8 (-AA), the IVS-I-110 (G----A) and the IVS-II-1 (G----A) mutations. The beta genes of two patients, including the 5' and 3' untranslated regions, were completely sequenced and no other mutations, except a few polymorphic sites, were observed. Dot-blot analyses failed to demonstrate this G----A mutation at +22 in nearly 400 beta-thalassemia chromosomes and 180 normal chromosomes. Heterozygotes have the features of a high Hb A2-beta-thalassemia heterozygosity, although the hematological parameters might be less abnormal than observed in heterozygotes for the more common beta-thalassemia mutations. The possibility has been presented suggesting that this mutation might impair the binding of mRNA to ribosomes. Another mutation in this segment of DNA, i.e. a C----G mutation at position +20, is observed exclusively on a chromosome which also carries the C----G mutation at IVS-II-745. It is postulated that the +20 C----G mutation accentuates the beta-thalassemia condition caused by the IVS-II-745 mutation; the mechanism might be similar to that suggested for the G----A at +22 mutation.
