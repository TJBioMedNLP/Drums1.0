Two families with hemoglobin Sogn, beta(A11)14 Leu----Arg, in Minnesota and Indiana: hematologic, functional, and biosynthetic features.
Sogn hemoglobinopathy was identified in a young American woman and in a young American man of apparently unrelated families of Norwegian ancestry. Both persons were asymptomatic and without clinical or hematologic manifestations. Hemoglobin Sogn, beta(A11)14 Leu----Arg, is an unstable hemoglobin that may easily be mistaken for hemoglobin S, G, or D by alkaline hemoglobin electrophoresis. These are the first known instances of hemoglobin Sogn outside of Norway. Oxygen affinity is normal. Sogn hemoglobinopathy is an incidental finding that has no adverse implication for the health of heterozygotes.
