Involvement of Glu G3(101)beta in the function of hemoglobin. Comparative O2 equilibrium studies of human mutant hemoglobins.
The glutamyl residue at G3(101)beta of normal hemoglobin (Hb A) is one of the alpha 1 beta 2 subunit contacts which are vital to O2 binding properties of the molecule. The O2 equilibrium properties of the four mutants with different substitutions at this site are studied in order to elucidate the role of this residue. Under stripped conditions with minimum chloride the order of O2 affinity is: Hb A (Glu) much less than Hb Rush (Gln) less than or equal to Hb British Columbia (Lys) less than or equal to Hb Potomac (Asp) less than or equal to Hb Alberta (Gly). The first Adair constants, K1, for the mutant hemoglobins are greater than that for Hb A whereas the fourth, K4, are similar, indicating that the allosteric constants (L) of these mutants are greatly reduced. Therefore, the G3(101)beta residue contributes intrinsically to the strengthening of the structural constraints that are imposed upon the deoxy (T) forms but not the oxy (R) form. On addition of 0.1 M Cl- and further addition of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or inositol hexaphosphate, their O2 affinities and cooperativities are altered, reflecting different responses to anionic ligands. Hb Rush exhibits a stronger chloride effect than Hb A and the other variants and, as a result, an increased Bohr effect and a smaller heat of oxygenation at pH 6.5. These changes are consistent with an increased positive net charge in the central cavity of Hb Rush and subsequent extra anion binding in the deoxy form. The tetramer to dimer dissociation constants are estimated to be greater than normal for Hb British Columbia and less than normal for Hb Alberta. This comparative study of the G3(101)beta mutants indicates that the size and the charge of this residue may influence the switching of two neighboring interchain hydrogen bonds that occurs during oxygenation of normal hemoglobin.
