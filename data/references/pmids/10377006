Increased occurrence of cleft lip in glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII): exclusion of a contiguous gene syndrome in two patients by presence of intragenic mutations including a novel nonsense mutation Gln58Stop.
Genetic deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase) results in the autosomal recessive disorder glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII) in which intralysosomal accumulation of glycogen primarily affects function of skeletal and cardiac muscle. During an earlier review we noted 3 in 100 cases of GSDII with incidental description of cleft lip. In addition, we identified 2 of 35 GSDII patients referred to us for molecular studies with co-occurence of cleft lip, considerably greater than the estimated frequency of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate of 1 in 700 to 1,000. Because several lines of evidence support a minor cleft lip/palate (Cl/P) locus on chromosome 17q close to the locus for GSDII, we defined the molecular basis for the GSDII in these two patients to determine if they represented a contiguous gene syndrome. Patient I (of Dutch descent) was homozygous and the parents heterozygous for an intragenic deletion of exon 18 (deltaex18), common in Dutch patients. Patient II was heterozygous for delta525T, a mutation also common in Dutch patients and a novel nonsense mutation (172 [corrected] C-->T; Gln58Stop) in exon 2, the first coding exon. The mother was heterozygous for the delta525T and the father for the 172 [corrected] C-->T; Gln58Stop. The finding that both patients carried intragenic mutations eliminates a contiguous gene syndrome. Whereas the presence of cleft lip/cleft palate in a patient with GSDII could be coincidental, these co-occurences could represent a modifying action of acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency on unlinked or linked genes that result in increased susceptibility for cleft lip.
