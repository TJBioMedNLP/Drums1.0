Dominant beta-thalassaemia: a highly unstable haemoglobin is caused by a novel 6 bp deletion of the beta-globin gene.
Beta-thalassaemia is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait in most families. Particular interest has recently been focused on the molecular pathology of the rare forms with a dominant mode of inheritance. The index patient and her mother, who are described in this report, displayed typical clinical and haematological features of beta-thalassaemia intermedia with significant ineffective erythropoiesis and additional peripheral haemolysis. Molecular analysis demonstrated a heterozygous genotype for a novel 6 bp (TGGTCT) deletion of the beta-globin gene involving codons 33-35. This deletion results in the removal of two valine residues from the beta-globin chain at position 33/34 (B15/B16) and the substitution of the tyrosine residue at position 35 (C1) by an aspartic acid (beta 33-35 [B15-C1] Val-Val-Tyr-->0-0-Asp). According to the index patient's place of birth, this abnormal haemoglobin has been termed Hb Dresden. The stability of the variant and the normal beta-globin chains were similar during the incubation period of in vitro globin chain synthesis analysis. However, Hb Dresden is exquisitely unstable and cannot be detected in the peripheral blood by haemoglobin electrophoresis, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or isoelectric focusing. This instability can be explained by the vital structural role of the three affected amino acids that, in normal haemoglobin, establish a total of nine intermolecular bonds (five hydrophobic and four polar) at both the alpha1beta1 (alpha2beta2) and the alpha1beta2 (alpha2beta1) interface.
