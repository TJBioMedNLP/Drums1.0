Beta 141 Leu is not deleted in the unstable haemoglobin Atlanta-Coventry but is replaced by a novel amino acid of mass 129 daltons.
Reinvestigation of the structure of the beta-chain of Hb Atlanta-Coventry (beta 75 Leu----Pro, beta 141 Leu deleted) confirmed the presence of two abnormalities; however, analysis of the aberrant beta Co14 tryptic peptide by liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry indicated that the beta 141 Leu (mass 113 daltons) was not deleted but replaced by a novel amino acid of mass 129 daltons. The new amino acid in peptide beta Co14 was uncharged at pH 6.5, more hydrophillic than leucine and susceptible to cleavage by both chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase A. We propose that the new residue is likely to be hydroxyleucine and that it results from post-translational oxidation of beta 141 Leu as a consequence of perturbation of the haem environment caused by the beta 75 Leu----Pro mutation in the E helix (E19). This proposal is entirely consistent with recent DNA analysis which showed that beta At-Co was not the product of a third beta-globin gene and that neither of the two beta-globin genes, beta A nor beta Atlanta, contained a deletion of the beta 141 Leu codon. We have subsequently found this modified amino acid at position beta 141 in two other unstable haemoglobins, both of which involve mutations on the haem side of the E helix.
