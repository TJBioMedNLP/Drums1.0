A second Australian family with hemoglobin North Shore (beta 134 Val----Glu).
A second Australian family is reported with Hemoglobin North Shore (beta 134 Val----Glu), an unstable hemoglobin, causing no clinical symptoms. All affected family members showed only mild reticulocytosis and microcytosis on the blood film, despite the strongly positive isopropanol test for Hb (hemoglobin) stability and numerous red cell inclusions. Hb North Shore constituted 31-38% of the total hemoglobin and migrated on the anodal side of Hb A at pH 8.9. The association of a mildly raised Hb A2 level and thalassemic phenotype with Hb North Shore previously reported, is confirmed in this study.
