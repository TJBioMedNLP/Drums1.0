Hemoglobin Debrousse (beta 96[FG3]Leu-->Pro): a new unstable hemoglobin with twofold increased oxygen affinity.
Hemoglobin Debrousse (beta 96[FG3]Leu-->Pro) is a new unstable variant, with high oxygen affinity responsible, in the steady state, for an apparently well-compensated chronic hemolytic anemia. The functional properties of this variant are due to the replacement of a leucine residue which is involved in the hydrophobic environment of the proximal side of the heme. This electrophoretically neutral hemoglobin was found as a de novo case in a 6-year-old girl suffering from severe anemia with hemolysis and transient aplastic crisis, following infection by parvovirus B19.
