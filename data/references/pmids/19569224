A genetic variants database for arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is a hereditary cardiomyopathy characterized by fibrofatty replacement of cardiomyocytes, ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death. ARVD/C is mainly caused by mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins. However, the pathogenicity of variants is not always clear. Therefore, we created an online database (www.arvcdatabase.info), providing information on variants in ARVD/C-associated genes. We searched the literature using ARVD/C and its underlying genes as search terms. From the selected papers and our unpublished data, we collected details on the type of mutation and information provided at the protein level. A "details page" contains clinical data and references. To aid the interpretation of missense mutations, we provide data from in silico prediction methods. In May 2009 the database contained 481 variants in eight genes. A total of 144 variants are considered pathogenic, 73 are unknown/unclassified, and 264 have no known pathogenicity. The database was converted into the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD) format, a gene-centered collection of DNA variations. The ARVD/C database will be useful for both researchers and clinicians. It can be searched to determine if variants have been published and whether they are considered pathogenic. External users are invited to add information to improve the quantity and quality of the data entered.
