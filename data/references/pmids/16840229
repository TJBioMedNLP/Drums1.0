Hb La Coruna [beta38(C4)Thr-->Ile]: a new hemoglobin variant leading to familial polycythemia.
Hb La Coruna [beta38(C4)Thr --> Ile] is a new hemoglobin (Hb) variant that has an increased oxygen affinity. Clinically, this Hb leads to erythrocytosis. Hb La Coruna is an electrophoretically silent variant that can be detected by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and characterized by DNA sequencing. The patient was a 22-year-old Spanish male whose family lived in La Coruna, in the northwest of Spain. His mother was also a carrier.
