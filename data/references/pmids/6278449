Restriction mapping of a new deletion responsible for G gamma (delta beta)o thalassemia.
DNA from individuals heterozygous for (G)gamma(deltabeta)(o) thalassaemia has been studied by restriction endonuclease analysis. The results reveal a new molecular defect associated with this condition. A total of three defects is now responsible for the one single phenotype, thereby emphasising the complex relationship between genotype and phenotype among the disorders of beta-like globin synthesis in man.
