Inhibition of oxygen-linked anion binding in Hb Camperdown [alpha 2 beta 2(104)(G6)Arg----Ser].
Oxygen equilibrium studies of purified Hb Camperdown [beta 104(G6) Arg----Ser] have revealed an increased oxygen affinity at acid pH, while it is decreased for pH values above 7.4. This accounts for an almost 40% reduction in the alkaline Bohr effect. The effects of chloride and organophosphate effectors on the oxygen affinity of Hb Camperdown are inhibited by 40-50%. In chloride-free Hepes buffer, Hb Camperdown exhibits a lower oxygen affinity than normal Hb A. The present results confirm the important role of the positively charged residues lining the beta 1 beta 2 interface in regulating the functional properties of hemoglobin.
