[A case of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome suspected from pulmonary hematoma due to disruption of the lung].
A 20-year-old man was referred to our hospital due to hemoptysis. Chest CT showed a ground-glass opacity, suggesting pulmonary bleeding; however, a diagnosis was not obtained. At a follow-up examination after 2 months, Chest CT showed improvement of the ground-glass opacity, however a cavitary nodule had newly appeared. Four months later, another new nodule was found on chest X-ray film. Video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy was performed for pathological diagnosis; disruption of the pleural, lung and blood vessels, and pulmonary hematoma were found. We thought of the fragility of the pleuro-pulmonary connective tissue and also thought of the probability of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). A biochemical analysis of cultured dermal fibroblasts and molecular biological examination revealed decreased production of type III collagen in fibroblasts and COL3A1 mutation. We diagnosed this case as vascular EDS. EDS is one of the differential diagnoses in patients presenting hemoptysis and pulmonary hematoma due to disruption of the lung.
