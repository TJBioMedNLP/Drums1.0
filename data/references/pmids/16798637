Hb Marineo [beta70(E14)Ala-->Val]: a silent hemoglobin variant with a mutation within the heme pocket.
We report a new hemoglobin (Hb) variant, Hb Marineo [beta70(E14)Ala --> Val], found in three generations of a family from West Sicily. The mutation is due to a GCC --> GTC substitution at codon 70 of the beta-globin gene. To date, three mutations at codon 70 of the beta-globin gene have been described, presenting with hemolytic anemia. In our case, no anemia or other alteration of hematological indices were found. Cation exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed a peak in the P2 window (VARIANT I), while a peak was detected by VARIANT II HPLC in the P3 window. Reversed phase HPLC analysis showed an abnormal chain amounting to about 40% of the total beta chains.
