The oxygen affinity of haemoglobin Tak, a variant with an elongated beta chain.
The oxygen affinity was investigated of purified Hb Tak, a human haemoglobin variant with elongated beta-chains. A very low P50 value was found which was not influenced by the addition of 2,3 diphosphoglycerate. The n value was 1, indicating non-cooperativity. The oxygen equilibrium curve of the whole blood haemolysate containing Hbs A and Tak was close to that of Hb A at the top of the curve, while the bottom of the curve greatly deviated from the latter, indicative of small if any interaction between Hb A and Tak during oxygenation.
