Vascular type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in a patient with ruptured aneurysm of the splenic artery.
A 39-year-old woman presented with a ruptured aneurysm of the splenic artery. The postoperative course was complicated by poor wound healing. This, in combination with a history of easy bruising and joint hypermobility, made us consider a connective tissue disease as underlying cause. The vascular type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was diagnosed by identifying collagen III deficiency and the corresponding gene mutation in cultured fibroblasts from a skin biopsy.
