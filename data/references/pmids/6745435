Hb Okazaki [beta 93(F8) Cys----Arg], a new hemoglobin variant with increased oxygen affinity and instability.
A new abnormal hemoglobin, Hb Okazaki [beta 93(F9) Cys----Arg], with an amino acid substitution at the tyrosine pocket of the beta chain as well as at the alpha 2 beta 1 contact of the quaternary structure of molecule, was discovered in a Japanese man. This hemoglobin showed increased oxygen affinity and molecular instability.
