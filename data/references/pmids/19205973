Hb North York [beta 117(G19)His-->Asp]: a new beta chain hemoglobin variant.
Routine hemoglobin (Hb) analysis identified a new beta chain Hb variant in an Iranian woman, who otherwise had normal hematological indices. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the Hb variant was due to a missense mutation at amino acid codon 117 (CAC>GAC, His-->Asp) of the beta-globin gene.
