Isolation and functional characterization of hemoglobin Casper: beta106(G8) Leu replaced by Pro.
Hemoglobin Casper (beta106Leu replaced by Pro) can be separated from hemoglobin (Hb) A by isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gel. This abnormal hemoglobin was estimated to be 30% of teh total by both isoelectric focusing and heat lability kinetics. Its oxygen equilibrium curves indicate a high oxygen affinity, low degree of subunit interaction, and a decreased Bohr effect. Mixtures of Hb Casper and Hb A appear to bind oxygen as if no hybrid molecules exist.
