Hemoglobin Linkoping [beta 36 (C2) Pro----Thr] in a large Finnish family from Astoria, Oregon, USA.
Eleven members of a large Finnish family from Astoria, Oregon were studied because of an erythrocytosis. No abnormality was detected by the usual hemoglobin electrophoretic tests, but an abnormal variant was separated by reverse phase HPLC. All of the affected individuals have an increased oxygen affinity with a P50 for whole blood at 37 degrees C averaging 18 torr. Fifty percent of their hemoglobin was found to have a threonyl residue in place of the normal prolyl residue at position 36 (C2) of the beta globin chain. This abnormality is identical to Hb Linkoping which was recently reported in a Finnish man living in Sweden.
