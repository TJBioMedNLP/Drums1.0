Mutation analysis in 46 British and Irish patients with Gaucher's disease.
DNA from 46 unrelated patients with Gaucher's disease was analysed for 10 known mutations: 84GG(c84 G 85ins), N370S (c1226G), L444P (c1448C), R463C (c1504T), R496H (c1604A), IVS2+1, D409H (c1342C), RecNcil (c1448C-1498C), RecTL (c1342C-1498C), and c1263del (c1264-1318del). Fifty four mutations (90%) were identified in 30 patients with type I disease. These included a previously undescribed recombinant mutation RecA456P (c1448C-1484C). Thirteen (54%) of 24 type II alleles were identified, including one new point mutation N462K (c1503G) and one new 55bp deletion also incorporating the RecTL mutations c1263del+RecTL (c1264del-1498C). All four type III patients were homozygous for the L444P point mutation. Generally, patients with one copy of the N370S mutation had mild adult onset disease, regardless of the nature of their second mutation. Three exceptions had childhood onset disease and genotypes N370S/R463C, N370S/RecA456P, and N370S/?. The L444P/L444P genotype was thought to be associated with neurological disease. Two type I patients with this genotype who exhibited no central nervous system disease were identified, however. The R463C and c1263del mutations were found to be present at a higher frequency than reported in other populations and they should be included in any mutation screen of this population. The recombinant mutations RecA456P and c1263del+RecTL have not been previously described and are the fourth and fifth recombinant mutations identified in the glucocerebrosidase gene.
