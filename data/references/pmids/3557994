Hemoglobin La Desirade alpha A2 beta 2 129 (H7) Ala----Val: a new unstable hemoglobin.
Hemoglobin La Desirade is a new unstable hemoglobin variant arising from the substitution of beta 129 (H7) Ala for Val. Hb La Desirade exhibits a low oxygen affinity and normal heme-heme interaction. The variant was found in two unrelated black families in association with Hb S, Hb C or beta o thalassemia.
