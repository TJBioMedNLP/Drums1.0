Spontaneous carotid cavernous fistula in Ehlers Danlos syndrome.
A patient is described with Ehlers Danlos syndrome presenting with spontaneous carotid cavernous fistula, in whom there was biochemical evidence for defective type III collagen synthesis. Despite the risks associated with arterial manipulation, the fistula was successfully closed by interventional neuroradiology and the patient has since remained well. This outcome is in contrast with the results in previous reports.
