Characterization of a new hemoglobin variant: Hb Badalona (beta31[B13]Leu-->Val).
Hemoglobin (Hb) Badalona was identified in a 35-year-old Spanish female and two other family members. All affected subjects presented erythrocytosis and increased oxygen affinity (P(50): 21 mmHg). Hemoglobinopathy was not detected with electrophoretic methods. It was, however, separated and quantified by cation exchange and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Hb Badalona accounted for 35% of the total Hb. No significant clinical symptoms were found to be related to this hemoglobinopathy. This is the first case of a Leu-->Val replacement at position beta31(B13) reported in the world literature.
