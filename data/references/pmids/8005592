A base substitution at IVS-19 3'-end splice junction causes exon 20 skipping in pro alpha 2(I) collagen mRNA and produces mild osteogenesis imperfecta.
Molecular investigations on a young patient and her family were undertaken to identify the molecular defect responsible for a mild form of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) with blue sclerae, dentinogenesis imperfecta and joint laxity. Analysis of collagenous proteins from the proband's fibroblasts showed the presence of two populations of alpha 2(I) chains, one normal and one migrating faster on SDS gels, thereby suggesting deletion of amino acid sequences. The faster migrating chains were retained mainly in the cell layer and not found in the extracellular matrix deposited by cultured fibroblasts. Chemical cleavage of mismatch (CCM) analysis on the patient's pro alpha 2(I) mRNA: normal cDNA heteroduplexes localized the molecular defect. cDNA sequencing revealed a deletion of exon 20 (54 bp) in about half of the molecules. Genomic DNA sequencing revealed heterozygosity for a G-to-C transversion of the last nucleotide of intron 19, which changed the 3' consensus splicing site. As a consequence pro alpha 2(I)mRNA was abnormally spliced from the last codon of exon 19 to the first codon of exon 21. To our knowledge, this is the first acceptor site mutation so far described in an OI patient. Restriction analysis indicated that the mutation was present also in three other affected family members. The full sequence of COL1A2 introns 19 and 20 are reported.
