The C-T substitution in the distal CACCC box of the beta-globin gene promoter is a common cause of silent beta thalassaemia in the Italian population.
This paper describes four families of Italian descent in each of which the propositus had the clinical phenotype of thalassaemia intermedia, resulting from the compound heterozygous state for high HbA2 beta thalassaemia and type I silent beta thalassaemia. Direct sequencing on amplified DNA and/or oligonucleotide analysis detected, in all families but one, the compound heterozygous state for codon 39 nonsense mutation and the C-T substitution at position -101 in the distal CACCC box of the beta-globin gene promoter (beta th-101). Members of these families who are heterozygous for high HbA2 beta thalassaemia showed the codon 39 nonsense mutation, while those with the clinical phenotype of silent beta thalassaemia had the beta th-101 mutation. In the remaining family, the propositus and one of his siblings had the compound heterozygous state for a molecularly undefined high HbA2 beta thalassaemia and the beta th-101 mutation in combination with the triple alpha globin gene arrangement. These patients showed a more severe thalassaemia intermedia like clinical phenotype as compared to those with the same beta-globin genotype and a normal alpha-globin gene arrangement. In the families investigated the beta th-101 was always associated with haplotype I. A group of patients with thalassaemia intermedia from Southern Italy, either homozygous or heterozygous for haplotype I and in whom previous studies had failed to define the mutation in one of the beta thalassaemia globin genes, were screened by oligonucleotide analysis for the presence of the beta th-101. Three out of nine were positive. These results indicate that the beta th-101 mutation is a common cause of the type I silent beta thalassaemia phenotype in the Southern Italian population.
