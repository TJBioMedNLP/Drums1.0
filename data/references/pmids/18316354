Immune reconstitution and recovery of FOXP3 (forkhead box P3)-expressing T cells after transplantation for IPEX (immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked) syndrome.
Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome is a rare X-linked disorder that usually presents in early childhood with immune enteropathy, diabetes mellitus, and other autoimmune complications. The disease is caused by mutations in the forkhead box P3 gene, a transcription factor that is essential for the development and function of regulatory T cells. This population of cells plays an essential role in controlling immune responses and preventing autoimmunity. Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome is often initially treated with immunosuppressive drugs, but only allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has offered the possibility of cure. We recently performed an unrelated donor transplant in a child with immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome by using a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen. This transplant provided a rare opportunity to gain valuable insight into the regeneration of the immune system after transplantation. Clinical recovery was associated with the emergence of regulatory T cell populations, the majority of which expressed memory phenotype markers and raised important questions about the origin and longevity of the FOXP3(+) regulatory T cell pool.
