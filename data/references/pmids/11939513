Hb G-San Jose variant levels correlate with alpha-thalassemia genotypes.
Hb G-San Jose or beta7(A4)Glu-->Gly has been reported in Southern Italian or Mexican families. We have studied four families from Sicily and Campania, Southern Italy. In six carriers, the hemoglobin variant level ranged from 32 to 38%. In four double heterozygotes for Hb G-San Jose and alpha-thalassemia the variant level showed a strong correlation with the alpha-thalassemia genotype. In fact, the variant level was 15% when interacting with the - (alpha)20.5/alphaalpha, 19.6% with the alphaalpha/alphaPoly Aalpha, and 24.8% with alphaalpha/alpha(-5) ntalpha genotypes. In two double heterozygotes for Hb G-San Jose and beta+ -IVS-I-6 (T-->C) the hemoglobin variant level was 67%. These data show that the reduced synthesis of alpha chains causes drastic reduction of probability to form Hb G-San Jose in favor of the formation of Hb A. Moreover, this reduction, (i) correlates with the type of alpha-thalassemia genotype and with the degree of the alpha chain deficiency, and (ii) is, most probably, more marked than the degree of alpha chain reduction. The minor affinity of the beta chain variant for the alpha chains associated with the reduced synthesis of the alpha chains is probably the principal cause of the variant hemoglobin reduction. Moreover, the rapid removal of the abnormal chains by proteolytic enzymes must have an essential role in order to reduce the chain variant pool. These conclusions are in agreement with the results obtained in reticulocyte and in vitro recombination experiments.
