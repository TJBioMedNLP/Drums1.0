A novel beta-thalassemia frameshift mutation (codon 14/15), detectable by direct visualization of abnormal restriction fragment in amplified genomic DNA.
A new frameshift mutation due to an insertion of G between codon 14/15 of the beta-globin gene was found in two unrelated Chinese patients with Cooley's anemia. The first patient (W.S.) was homozygous for haplotype 5 (Chinese) and carried a codon 41/42 (four base pair deletion) mutant, while the second patient (C.K.) was homozygous for haplotype 2 (Chinese), and also had a codon 17 (A----T) nonsense mutation. Molecular cloning and M13 sequencing of the beta gene in patient W.S. revealed that the new mutant was found in a beta-globin gene framework type 3 (Asian). Direct sequencing was performed on polymerase chain reaction-amplified genomic DNA from patient C.K. With the new mutation, an additional BstNI or EcoRII recognition site is generated and the abnormal restriction fragment (134 basepair) can be directly visualized on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the amplified genomic DNA.
