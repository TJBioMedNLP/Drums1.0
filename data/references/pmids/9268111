Mutation producing alternative splicing of exon 26 in the COL1A2 gene causes type IV osteogenesis imperfecta with intrafamilial clinical variability.
We have characterized a familial form of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Following the identification by ultrasound of short limbs and multiple fractures in a fetus at 25 weeks of gestation, the family was referred with a provisional diagnosis of severe OI. We detected subtle clinical and radiological signs of OI in the father and in the paternal grandmother of the proposita, who had never received a diagnosis of OI. Linkage analysis indicated COL1A2 as the disease locus. Heteroduplex analysis of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification products of pro alpha2(I) mRNA from an affected member and subsequent sequencing of the candidate region demonstrated the presence of normal transcripts and a minority of transcripts lacking exon 26 (54 bp) of COL1A2. Sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA identified an A --> G transition in the moderately conserved +3 position of the IVS 26 donor splice site. The mutant pre-mRNA molecules were alternatively spliced, yielding both full-length and deleted transcripts that represented less than 30% of the total pro alpha2(I) mRNA. The biochemical data on type I collagen synthesized by dermal fibroblasts showed intracellular retention of the mutant protein; failure to detect the shortened alpha2(I) chains either in the medium or in the cell layer may be the consequence of their instability at physiological temperature. These observations justified the mild resulting phenotype.
