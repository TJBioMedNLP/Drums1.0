Spectrum and distribution of MECP2 mutations in 424 Rett syndrome patients: a molecular update.
Mutations in the MECP2 (Methyl-CpG-binding protein) gene have been reported to cause Rett syndrome (RTT), an X-linked progressive encephalopathy. Recent studies have identified large gene rearrangements that escape the common PCR-based mutation screening strategy and mutations in a novel MeCP2 isoform (named MECP2B). We have collected the results of MECP2 mutational analysis concerning 424 RTT patients conducted in eight laboratories in France. In total, 121 different MECP2 mutations were identified. R168X (11.5%) is the most common of MECP2 mutations, followed by R270X (9%), R255X (8.7%), T158 M (8.3%) and R306C (6.8%). Only eight mutations had relative frequency>3%. Large and complex rearrangements not previously detected using only a PCR-based strategy represent 5.8% of MECP2 mutations. On the contrary, mutation in exon 1 appears to be rare (less than 0.5%). These data demonstrate the high allelic heterogeneity of RTT in France and suggest that routine mutation screening in MECP2 should include quantitative analysis of the MECP2 gene. This study represents an important instrument for molecular diagnosis strategy and genetic counseling in RTT families.
