Isolation of high oxygen affinity hemoglobins.
This paper describes a method for isolating high oxygen affinity hemoglobins. It involves the selective derivatisation of the cysteine residue at position 93 in the beta chain. The iodoacetamide derivative of the high oxygen affinity hemoglobin was separated from the more negatively charged iodoacetic acid derivative of HbA on DEAE-Sephadex. The method was used to isolate two high oxygen affinity hemoglobins, one of which was subsequently identified as Hb Heathrow.
