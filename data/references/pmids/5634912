Hemoglobin Hijiyama: a new fast-moving hemoglobin in a Japanese family.
A variant of hemoglobin A, named Hb Hijiyama, found in two generations of a Japanese family living in Hiroshima, Japan, has a higher anodal electrophoretic mobility than hemoglobin A; a gain of two negative charges per molecule is indicated. Fingerprinting and amino acid analysis showed the biochemical anomaly to be in the beta chain at residue 120, where lysine is replaced by glutamic acid. In the heterozygote carriers of the abnormal hemoglobin there is no apparent association with clinical or hematologic abnormalities.
