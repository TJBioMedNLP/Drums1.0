Hemoglobin Richmond. Subunit dissociation and oxygen equilibrium properties.
In hemoglobin Richmond (beta102 leads to Lys), amino acid substitution has occurred at the same site as the mutation in hemoglobin Kansas (beta102 Asn leads to Thr), a variant with very low oxygen affinity. Although hemoglobin Richmond has been shown to have increased tetramer-dimer dissociation, its oxygen affinity has been inferred to be normal from studies on hemolysates of carriers. We have isolated hemoglobin Richmond and have further studied its properties. We confirm that the oxygen affinity of pure hemoglobin Richmond under conditions similar to those found in vivo is normal. However, the Bohr effect of the variant hemoglobin is markedly abnormal. Its oxygen affinity is low at high pH and high at low pH, relative to hemoglobin A. The tetramer-dimer equilibrium displays a strong pH dependence such that protons promote dissociation. A model is presented in which the structural change in hemoglobin Richmond results in low oxygen affinity, like hemoglobin Kansas. However, the close linkage between tetramer-dimer dissociation and proton concentration seen with hemoglobin Richmond results in normal oxygen affinity at intracellular pH and hemoglobin concentration, and carriers display no hematological abnormalities.
