Intractable diarrhea after liver transplantation for Byler's disease: successful treatment with bile adsorptive resin.
Intractable diarrhea and prolonged growth retardation after liver transplantation for Byler's disease are serious complications limiting the ultimate outcome of liver transplantation for this disease. However, details of these complications have not been documented thoroughly. Six patients with Byler's disease developed intractable diarrhea after living donor liver transplantation. Because of high bile acid concentrations in stool, four patients were treated with bile acid adsorptive resin for bile acid diarrhea, and all showed improved bowel movements. Four of these patients who were followed up for 1 year registered a significant height gain. Also, the cause of postoperative diarrhea and growth retardation in patients with Byler's disease after liver transplantation is discussed.
