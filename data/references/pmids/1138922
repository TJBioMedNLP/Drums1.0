Haemoglobin Camperdown beta104(G6) arginine leads to serine.
Routine investigation of ante natal patients revealed a subtle change in the electrophoretic pattern on cellulose acetate of the proposita. Further investigations by isoelectric focussing in polyacrylamide gel suggested the presence of two major haemoglobin components. Using a modified cellulose acetate technique globin chain separation revealed an abnormal beta-chain. Chain separation on a carboxymethyl-cellulose column provided a pure sample of the abnormal beta-chain. After amino-ethylation, tryptic digestion and peptide mapping, amino acid analysis of relevant peptides showed the abnormality in the beta-chain to be a substitution of arginine by serine at the 104 position. The presence of a positively charged residue at this position would appear to be necessary for the stabilization of the haemoglobin central cavity. The replacement by serine in this haemoglobin leads to slightly decreased stability but does not appear to affect the oxygen affinity.
