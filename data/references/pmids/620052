A new hemoglobin variant. HB Yatsushiro alpha 2 A beta 2 60 Val replaced by Leu.
This study was performed to establish the structural abnormality of a new hemoglobin variant discover-d in a Japanese patient with angina pectoris. The hybridization of the separated hemoglobin with canine hemoglobin revealed a beta-chain anomaly. Peptide betaTp-6 was found to be abnormally located on the peptide map of tryptic digests of the S-carboxymethylated beta-chain from the variant hemoglobin. A structural study on the abnormal betaTp-6 revealed that the variant hemoglobin differs from hemoglobin A by substitution of leucine for valine at residue 60 of the beta-chain. This new variant hemoglobin is designated as hemoglobin Yatsushiro after the name of the city where the propositus lived. The patient is hematologically healthy and his clinical history has nothing to do with this abnormal hemoglobin.
