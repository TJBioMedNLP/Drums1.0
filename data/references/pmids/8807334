A sensitive mutation screening strategy for Fabry disease: detection of nine mutations in the alpha-galactosidase A gene.
Fabry disease is an X-linked recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-gal; EC 3.2.1.22). In the past, it has been difficult to give an unequivocal diagnosis of carrier status in Fabry disease because of the overlap between normal and heterozygote enzyme levels. To facilitate rapid and accurate carrier and hemizygote detection, a mutation detection strategy was devised to determine the lesion in our Fabry disease patients. The seven alpha-gal exons and adjacent intron boundaries from a representative member of each kindred were PCR amplified and analysed for the presence of sequence alterations by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis followed by PCR sequencing. Here we report the use of this strategy in the detection and analysis of the causative mutations in 9 patients with classic severe Fabry disease. Three deletions of 1-, 2-, and 3-bp (987delC, 717delAA, and delta E358), five amino acid substitutions (C52R, G128E, P205T, M284T, and N298K) and a mutation that affects the initiating methionine (M1I) were found in these patients. Counting a previously reported mutation, this strategy has now successfully detected all the Fabry disease mutations present in the 10 kindreds that have been analysed.
