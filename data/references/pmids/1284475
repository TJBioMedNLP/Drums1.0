Lethal perinatal osteogenesis imperfecta due to a type I collagen alpha 2(I) Gly to Arg substitution detected by chemical cleavage of an mRNA:cDNA sequence mismatch.
A single base mismatch was detected by a chemical cleavage method in heteroduplexes formed between patient mRNA and a control collagen alpha 2(I) cDNA probe in a case of osteogenesis imperfecta type II. The region of the mRNA mismatch was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction, cloned and sequenced. A heterozygous point mutation of G to C at base pair 1,774 of the collagen alpha 2(I) mRNA resulted in the substitution of glycine with arginine at amino acid position 457 of the helix. Type I collagen of alpha 1(I)- and alpha 2(I)-chains from the patient migrated slowly on electrophoresis due to increased levels of posttranslational modification of lysine. The parents' fibroblast collagen did not contain the mRNA mismatch and the collagens showed normal electrophoretic behaviour. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of the CNBr peptides from the patient's collagen confirmed the excessive posttranslational modification of the alpha 1(I)- and alpha 2(I)-chains in the CNBr peptides N-terminal to the mutation due to disruption of the obligatory Gly-X-Y triplet repeat of the helix. The mutation led to reduced procollagen secretion and helix destabilization as evidenced by a decreased thermal stability. These data lend further support to the accumulating evidence that type I collagen alpha 2(I) glycine substitution mutations result in the same spectrum of clinical severity as those in the alpha 1(I)-chain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
