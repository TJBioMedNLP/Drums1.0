Genetic skeletal disorders of the fetus and infant: pathologic and molecular findings in a series of 41 cases.
BACKGROUND: Genetic skeletal disorders of the fetus and infant are a large group of genetic disorders, comprising the groups formerly assigned as skeletal dysplasias (osteochondrodysplasias), dysostoses, and malformation syndromes with a skeletal component. Genetic skeletal disorders may be prenatally detected by ultrasonography or result in intrauterine or early postnatal death, constituting one difficult diagnostic field met by the pathologist who performs the perinatal autopsy. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we have gathered radiologic, physical, histopathologic, and molecular data regarding 41 cases of genetic skeletal disorders diagnosed among 1980 fetal and perinatal autopsies over a 10-year period. RESULTS: Our series of cases were classified according to the 2006 Nosology and Classification of Genetic Skeletal Disorders. The overall frequency of genetic skeletal disorders was 1:48 autopsies. The FGFR3 group and osteogenesis imperfecta type 2 were the more frequently encountered disorders. The mean gestational age at autopsy was 21.9 weeks (range, 12-37 weeks). A final diagnosis was obtained in 95% of cases. Genetic skeletal disorders were detected by prenatal ultrasound in 90% of cases, with a correct typing of the disorder achieved in only 34%. Molecular analysis was confirmative in 5 cases. CONCLUSIONS: The central role of the perinatal pathologist in collaboration with specialized services is essential for the correct interpretation of the radiologic, physical, and histopathologic findings, to accurately classify specific types of genetic skeletal disorders and enable genetic counseling.
