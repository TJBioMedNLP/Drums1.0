Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VII: clinical features and molecular defects.
We evaluated the clinical features, molecular defects, and problems associated with the management of two patients who had type-VII Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and reviewed the cases of eighteen patients with this condition who had been reported on previously. The typical clinical features associated with this syndrome include bilateral congenital dislocation of the hip; severe generalized hypermobility of the joints; multiple dislocations of joints other than the hip; muscular hypotonia; and hyperelasticity, fragility, and a doughy texture of the skin. Collagen and DNA analyses demonstrated that both of our patients had type-VIIB Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which is caused by heterozygous new mutations of the COL1A2 gene that encodes the proalpha2(I) chain of type-I procollagen. The obligatory GT dinucleotide at the splice donor site of intron 6 was altered in both of our patients: one patient (Case 1) had an A substitution of the G nucleotide, and the other patient (Case 2) had a C substitution of the T nucleotide. Abnormal splicing resulted in the loss of the exon 6-encoded N-telopeptide, which includes the N-proteinase cleavage site. Despite multiple operative procedures, one of our patients, who was thirty-seven years old at the time of the most recent follow-up, continued to have persistent subluxation of the right hip and osteoarthritis of the left hip. Closed reduction of the dislocated hips, regardless of the type of immobilization used, was unsuccessful in all twenty patients. The results of open reduction were improved when capsulorrhaphy was combined with iliac or femoral osteotomy, or both.
