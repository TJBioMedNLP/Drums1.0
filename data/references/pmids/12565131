No association of mutations and mRNA expression of WFS1/wolframin with bipolar disorder in humans.
Association of WFS1 (wolframin) and bipolar disorder has been suggested by psychiatric manifestations in patients or non-symptomatic carriers of Wolfram disease and linkage of bipolar disorder with 4p16, the locus of WFS1. Five studies of WFS1 in bipolar disorder did not support this association, although possible association of several missense mutations has not been excluded yet. In this study, four such mutations were genotyped in 184 patients with bipolar disorder and 207 controls. None had the A559T and A602V mutations, and no association of G576S and H611R with bipolar disorder was found. We also quantified the expression levels of WFS1 mRNA in the postmortem brains of patients with bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia, and controls. There was no significant difference of the expression levels. These results did not support the pathophysiological significance of WFS1 in bipolar disorder.
