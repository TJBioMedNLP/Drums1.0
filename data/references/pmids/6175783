First Japanese family with the unstable hemoglobin Zurich [beta 63(e7) His leads to Arg].
Abnormal hemoglobin, which was latter identified as hemoglobin Zurich, was discovered in a 45-year-old female with severe valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure and moderate anemia and hyperbilirubinemia. Same abnormal hemoglobin was demonstrated in her two apparently healthy sons. This is the first reported family of hemoglobin Zurich in Japan.
