A new fast-moving variant causing erythrocytosis and mild hemolysis: Hb Gambara [beta 82(EF6)Lys-->Glu].
Hb Gambara is a new hemoglobin variant with abnormal beta chains that has been found in three out of four members of a family of Lombardy origin (Gambara, Brescia, Northern Italy). The affected subjects led a normal life, but they had modest erythrocytosis and mild (compensated) hemolysis with slight splenomegaly. Their abnormal hemoglobin was about 52% of the total hemoglobin, and was shown to be stable by the isopropanol test. Whole blood P50 of the proband was 19.3 Torr, Bohr effect was decreased (-0.25), as well as the molar ratio between the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate level and total hemoglobin of erythrocytes (0.68). The purified abnormal hemoglobin was characterized by an altered oxygen affinity, low n-factor, chloride, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate effects. The Bohr effect was about 40% of the normal control. The abnormal hemoglobin moved faster than Hb A at alkaline electrophoresis, and split into two fractions, probably due to the formation of hybrid tetramers (alpha 2 beta A beta X). The reversed phase high performance liquid chromatogram from the tryptic digest of the aminoethylated abnormal beta chain subunits indicated the presence of an extra peptide, beta T-9, 10, replacing the individual peptides beta T-9 and beta T-10. Finally, the proband's DNA, drawn from a suitable segment of the beta structural gene (exon 2), revealed a nucleotide sequence carrying the heterozygous mutation AAG-->GAG at codon 82. This led to a Lys-->Glu substitution at position 82(EF6) of the beta chain.
