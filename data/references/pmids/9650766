A novel mutation of the beta-glucocerebrosidase gene associated with neurologic manifestations in three sibs.
We report on a sibship in which three members were affected by Gaucher disease. Molecular analysis of the patients showed homozygosity for a novel mutation (C5390G) of the beta-glucocerebrosidase gene, resulting in the substitution of the arginine 353 with a glycine. Western blot analysis showed a reduced amount of beta-glucocerebrosidase-related polypeptides in fibroblasts. The phenotype resulting from this mutation is characterized by visceral and skeletal manifestations. In addition, the presence of seizures and electrophysiological abnormalities only in the 3 patients and in none of the other unaffected sibs suggests that the mutation is responsible for neurologic involvement.
