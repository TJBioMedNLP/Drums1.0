Mutations for Gaucher disease confer high susceptibility to Parkinson disease.
BACKGROUND: Increased frequency of pathogenic variants in GBA, the causative gene for Gaucher disease, has been suggested to be associated with Parkinson disease (PD). OBJECTIVES: To conduct comprehensive resequencing of GBA to identify all sequence variants and to investigate the association of these variants with PD. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Multicenter university-based study. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred thirty-four patients with PD, 34 families in which multiple patients with PD are present, and 544 control subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease status and GBA variations. RESULTS: Comprehensive resequencing of GBA in 534 patients with PD and 544 controls revealed 27 sequence variants: 11 pathogenic variants associated with Gaucher disease, 11 nonsynonymous variants not associated with Gaucher disease, and 5 synonymous variants. Fifty patients with PD (9.4%) had 1 of the 11 pathogenic variants in the heterozygous state, whereas only 2 controls (0.37%) had such variants (odds ratio, 28.0). Among the pathogenic variants, R120W and L444P/RecNciI were highly prevalent, and each showed a significant association with PD. Furthermore, other rare pathogenic variants were found in 13 patients with PD but not in the controls, further confirming the role of these rare variants in the susceptibility to PD. Patients with PD carrying pathogenic variants were significantly younger than those not carrying them. In addition, concordance of PD states and pathogenic variants was observed in 8 multiplex families with PD. CONCLUSION: Heterozygous pathogenic variants in GBA confer a high risk for sporadic PD, even for familial clustering, and are associated with significantly earlier age at onset of disease.
