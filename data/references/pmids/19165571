Naxos disease presenting with ventricular tachycardia and troponin elevation.
Naxos disease is a recessively inherited stereotype association of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with a cutaneous phenotype, characterized by peculiar woolly hair and palmoplantar keratoderma. The cardiomyopathy clinically manifests by adolescence and the symptomatic presentation is usually with syncope and/or sustained ventricular tachycardia of left bundle branch block configuration. We report the case of a 43-year-old man without any history of heart disease who was admitted to the hospital because of an episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia and troponin I elevation, in the absence of coronary artery disease. Diagnostic workup, including genetic assessment, revealed Naxos disease as the underlying cause. In this case, acute myocarditis seems to be the most plausible explanation for the nonischemic myocardial injury.
