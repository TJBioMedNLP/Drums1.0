Hemoglobin Crete (beta 129 ala leads to pro): a new high-affinity variant interacting with beta o -and delta beta o -thalassemia.
Hemoglobin Crete, beta129 (h7)ala leads to pro, is a new mutant hemoglobin (Hb) with high oxygen affinity that was discovered in a Greek family in various combinations with beta- and deltabeta-thalassemia. The propositus, who presented an unusual clinical picture of an "overcompensated" hemolytic state, with erythrocytosis, splenomegaly, abnormal red cell morphology, and marked erythroid hyperplasia, appeared doubly heterozygous for Hb Crete and deltabeta-thalassemia. His red cells contained 67% Hb Crete and 30% Hb F, and the combination of these two hemoglobins resulted in a blood P50O2 of 11.2 mm Hg. A brother with Hb Crete trait (38% Hb Crete, 56% Hb A, blood P50O2 23.0 mm Hg) did not have significant erythrocytosis. Purified Hb Crete was heat-unstable and exhibited a high oxygen affinity, and a normal Bohr effect. We postulate that the beta 129 proline substitution disrupts the H helix, perturbing nearby residues involved in alpha 1 beta 1 contact sites of the Hb tetramer.
