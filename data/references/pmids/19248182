An unusual presentation of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome vascular type with deep vein thrombosis: a case for multidisciplinary management.
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) vascular type typically presents with significant vascular complications such as rupture of blood vessels, gravid uterus, or intestinal perforation. We report on a 24-year-old female that presents with deep vein thrombosis found to be due to compression by a large posterior tibial artery pseudoaneurysm which ultimately leads to the patient's diagnosis. This case highlights the need for a multidisciplinary approach involving vascular surgery, internal medicine, genetics, and other health care providers for patients with vascular type EDS.
