Clinical features of Japanese families with a 402delT or a 555-556delAG mutation in choroideremia gene.
PURPOSE: To characterize the clinical features of two Japanese families with choroideremia associated with a 402delT and a 555-556delAG mutation in the choroideremia gene (CHM). METHODS: Four affected members and one obligate carrier from two Japanese families with choroideremia were studied. To detect mutations of the CHM gene, the products of polymerase chain reaction were directly sequenced in both directions. The ophthalmologic examination included best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, fundus examination, kinetic perimetry, electroretinography, and fluorescein angiography. RESULTS: A 402delT and a 555-556delAG mutation were found in two Japanese families with choroideremia. All affected members had night-blindness, progressive constriction of the visual field, chorioretinal atrophy, and mottled appearance of the retinal pigment epithelium. The obligate carrier had mild patchy areas of retinal pigment epithelial atrophy with no visual symptoms. CONCLUSION: The authors found a 402delT and a 555-556delAG mutation in the CHM gene, one of which (402delT) is a novel mutation. They conclude that these mutations cause choroideremia in Japanese families.
