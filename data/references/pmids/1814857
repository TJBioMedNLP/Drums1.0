Application of reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography and plasma desorption mass spectrometry for the characterization of a hemoglobin variant.
An abnormal hemoglobin was structurally characterized by use of reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography in combination with plasma desorption mass spectrometry for peptide identification. The study was accomplished using approximately 150 micrograms of hemoglobin and unambiguously demonstrated the variant to be beta 104(G6)Arg----Ser, known as Hb Camperdown.
