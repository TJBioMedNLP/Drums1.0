The 'hot-spot' of Hb E [beta26(B8)Glu-->Lys] in Southeast Asia: beta-globin anomalies in the Lao Theung population of southern Laos.
Hb E [beta26(B8)Glu-->Lys], is the most common abnormal hemoglobin (Hb) in Southeast Asian populations. The hitherto highest frequencies of the Hb E gene (HBB*E) in large population samples, approximately 0.3, were observed in the southern part of northeastern Thailand. The finding of even higher frequencies in a small, isolated Austroasiatic group in Northeast Thailand prompted us to examine samples of three Austroasiatic populations in southern Laos (official designation: Lao Theung), an area inhabited by numerous ethnic groups belonging to the Mon-Khmer branch. Blood samples were collected from a total of 603 adult subjects. The HBB*E frequencies were 0.426 in the So of Khammuan Province, 0.433 in the Alak/Ngeh of Sekong Province and 0.253 in the Oy of Attapeu Province. The HBB*E frequencies in the So and Alak/Ngeh are the highest observed in Southeast Asia in representative population samples. None of the common Southeast Asian beta-thalassemia (thal) mutations were found. The results are discussed with respect to natural selection by malaria, selection time, effects of beta-thal and the ethnic history of the population of Southeast Asia.
