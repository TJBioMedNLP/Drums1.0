Haemoglobin Saki alpha 2 beta 2 14 Leu-Pro(a11) structure and function.
The characterization of haemoglobin Saki alpha 2 beta 2 14 Leu-Pro(a11) is described. This new mutation is unique since it only induces modification of the stability of the molecule. In vitro precipitation of haemoglobin Saki upon heat or in the presence of chemicals is compared to the stability of haemoglobin A and haemoglobin S.
