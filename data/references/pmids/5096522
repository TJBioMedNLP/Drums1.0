Hemoglobin Louisville (beta-42 (CD1) phe-leu): an unstable variant causing mild hemolytic anemia.
An unstable hemoglobin variant termed Hb Louisville, was found in four members of a Caucasian family, who were suffering from a mild hemolytic anemia. The variant showed a decreased stability upon warming at 65 degrees C and an increased tendency to dissociate in the presence of sulfhydryl group-blocking agents. The structural abnormality was identified as a replacement of phenylalanyl residue in position 42 (CD1) by a leucyl residue. Substitution of this phenylalanyl residue, which participates in the contact with heme, by a nonpolar leucyl residue has apparently less severe consequences than a replacement of the same residue by a polar seryl residue as in Hb Hammersmith. Oxygen equilibrium studies of total hemolysate from one Hb Louisville heterozygote indicated a decreased oxygen affinity, a marked decrease in heme-heme interaction, and a normal Bohr effect. Studies with isolated Hb Louisville were not made because it was not possible to separate the variant from normal Hb A.
