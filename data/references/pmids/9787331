Characterization of hemoglobin Hotel Dieu in a Puerto Rican adolescent.
PURPOSE: Hemoglobin Hotel Dieu (HbHD) is a high-oxygen affinity variant of HbA never before reported in a Hispanic patient. This Hb variant was first reported in 1981 by Blouquit et al. in a white person with erythrocytosis with a substitution in the beta 99 aspartic acid residue by glycine. METHODS: A 13-year-old Puerto Rican boy had pain in his chest, headaches, easy fatigability, and high Hb (as high as 19.1 g/dl). Protein analysis was performed by cellulose acetate, citrate agar, and isoelectric focusing electrophoresis and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, and DNA sequencing of the second exon of the beta gene in samples obtained from the mother, father, and the patient, and DNA fingerprinting to determine paternity. RESULTS: The variant found in the patient migrated on cellulose acetate electrophoresis to a cathodic position relative to HbF, and a band cathodal to HbA and close to HbF on isoelectric focusing electrophoresis. The patient showed an abnormal well-resolved peak on HPLC with a retention time slightly shorter than that for HbS. DNA analysis by direct sequencing of the PCR product demonstrated heterozygosity for codon 99 (GAT-->GGT) in the patient but not in either parent. DNA fingerprinting by multiplex PCR amplification of three simple tandem repeat loci showed that the patient shared alleles in all three loci with both parents, ruling out nonpaternity. CONCLUSIONS: The protein and DNA analysis indicate that the erythrocytosis is caused by the presence of HbHD in this Hispanic adolescent.
