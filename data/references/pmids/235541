The effects of inositol hexaphosphate on the allosteric properties of two beta-99-substituted abnormal hemoglobins, hemoglobin Yakima and hemoglobin Kempsey.
Hemoglobins (Hb) Yakima and Kempsey were purified from patients' blood with diethylaminoethyl cellulose column chromatography. The oxygen equilibrium curves of the two hemoglobins and the effects of organic phosphates on the function were investigated. In 0.1 M phosphate buffer, Hill's constants n for Hb Yakima and Hb Kempsey were 1.0 to 1.1 at the pH range for 6.5 to 8.0 and the oxygen affinities of both the mutant hemoglobins were about 15 to 20 times that of Hb A at pH 7.0. The Bohr effect was normal in Hb Yakima and one-fourth normal in Hb Kempsey. In the presence of inositol hexaphosphate, the oxygen affinities to Hb Yakima and Hb Kempsey were greatly decreased, and an interesting result revealed that these hemoglobins showed clear cooperativity in oxygen binding. Hill's constant n in the presence of inositol hexaphosphate was 1.9 for Hb Kempsey and 2.3 for Hb Yakima at pH 7.0. The cooperativities of these mutant hemoglobins were pH-dependent, and Hb Kempsey showed high cooperativity at low pH (n equal 2.1 at pH 6.6) and low cooperativity at high pH (n equal 1.0 at pH 8.0). Hb Yakima showed similar pH dependence in cooperativity. In the presence of inositol hexaphosphate, Hb A showed a pH-dependent cooperativity different from those of Hb Yakima and Hb Kempsey, namely, Hill's n was the highest in alkaline pH (n equal 3.0 at pH 8.0) and decreased at lower pH (n equal 1.5 at pH 6.5). 2,3Diphosphoglycerate bound with the deoxygenated Hb Yakima and Hb Kempsey, however, had no effect on the oxygen binding of these abnormal hemoglobin. The pH-dependent cooperativity of alpha1beta2 contact anomalous hemoglobin and normal hemoglobin was explained by the shifts in the equilibrium between the high and low ligand affinity forms.
