Substitutions in the conserved C2C domain of otoferlin cause DFNB9, a form of nonsyndromic autosomal recessive deafness.
DFNB, the nonsyndromic hearing loss with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance constitutes the majority of severe to profound prelingual forms of hearing impairment, usually leading to inability of speech acquisition. We analyzed a consanguineous family with autosomal recessive deafness which has been shown to segregate within chromosomal region 2p23.1 (DFNB9; MIM 601071). By SSCP analysis and DNA sequencing of the 48 exons of the DFNB9 gene, coding for otoferlin, previously reported mutations in OTOF were excluded. Next to a frequent T > C single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 8, two novel mutations linked in exon 15 of the OTOF long splice form were identified comprising substitutions at positions 490 (Pro > Gln) and 515 (Ile > Thr), both located in the conserved Ca(2+) binding C2C domain of this peptide. Comparisons of homology using human and mice otoferlins and closely related peptides and computer simulation analyses suggest that changes in the mutated segment's secondary structure affect the Ca(2+) binding capacity of the C2C domain in otoferlin.
