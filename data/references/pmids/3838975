Hemoglobin kenitra alpha 2 beta 2 69 (E13) Gly----Arg. A new beta variant of elevated expression associated with alpha-thalassemia, found in a Moroccan woman.
Hemoglobin Kenitra is a new variant of the beta chain alpha 2 beta 2 69 (E13) Gly----Arg which does not produce any clinical symptoms. It is a slow-moving hemoglobin with a distinctive pattern of electrophoretic mobilities. The stability test was negative. Oxygen affinity studies were not performed. It was found in association with alpha-thalassemia and microcytosis, but paradoxically a high expression of the variant (55%) was observed.
