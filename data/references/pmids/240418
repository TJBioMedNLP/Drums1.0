Hemoglobin Cochin-Port-Royal: consequences of the replacement of the beta chain C-terminal by an arginine.
Hemoglobin Cochin Port-Royal beta 146 (HC3) His yields Arg is the second example in which the beta C-terminal residue is replaced. Owing to the known importance of His beta 146 in the co-operative effects of hemoglobin, the functional properties of this variant were carefully studied. It had a normal Hill coefficient but a reduced alkaline Bohr effect. However, the reduction in Bohr effect is less than the halving predicted from previous mutants and modified hemoglobins.
