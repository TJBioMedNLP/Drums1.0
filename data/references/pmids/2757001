Hb Warsaw (beta 42 Phe----Val): an unstable hemoglobin with decreased oxygen affinity. I. Hematologic and clinical expression.
Four members in two generations of a Polish-American family exhibited findings of congenital Heinz-body hemolytic anemia accompanied by cyanosis. Two of the affected family members have also developed severe pulmonary hypertension, with a fatal outcome in one of them. Blood from the affected individuals showed decreased oxygen affinity and contained elevated levels of methemoglobin. An unstable hemoglobin fraction underwent rapid precipitation following exposure of the red cell lysates to isopropyl alcohol or heat. This hemoglobin contained a newly identified abnormal beta chain with an amino acid substitution at the same position as that of Hb Hammersmith and Hb Bucuresti-Louisville.
