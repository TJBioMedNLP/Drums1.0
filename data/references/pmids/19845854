ABCB11 gene mutations in Chinese children with progressive intrahepatic cholestasis and low gamma glutamyltransferase.
BACKGROUND: Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (PFIC2) is a severe autosomal recessive liver disorder of childhood that can cause cholestasis and progress to end-stage liver disease. ABCB11 gene mutations causing PFIC2 have been reported in some population groups, but not in mainland Chinese. AIMS: To elucidate the existence of and characterize ABCB11 gene mutations in mainland Chinese with progressive intrahepatic cholestasis and low gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT). METHODS: Twenty-four children presenting with progressive intrahepatic cholestasis and low GGT were admitted to a tertiary paediatric hospital in eastern China from January 2004 to July 2007. All encoding exons and flanking areas of the ABCB11 gene were sequenced. Hepatic histopathology results were obtained by review of the medical record. RESULTS: Twelve novel mutations of ABCB11 gene were found in seven patients: three nonsense mutations, six missense mutations, two splicing mutations and one intronic mutation. Giant cell transformation of hepatocytes was demonstrated in all the four patients with ABCB11 mutations and four of 12 patients without mutations in coding sequences of ABCB11 gene who received liver needle biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: ABCB11 gene mutations play an important role in Chinese patients with progressive intrahepatic cholestasis and low GGT. The characteristics of ABCB11 gene mutations in Chinese are different from other population groups. Histological examination may be helpful in diagnosis of PFIC2.
