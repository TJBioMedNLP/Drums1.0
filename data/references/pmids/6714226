Molecular characterization of seven beta-thalassemia mutations in Asian Indians.
To characterize systematically the mutations which produce beta-thalassemia in Asian Indians, we first determined the DNA polymorphism haplotype in the beta-globin gene cluster of 44 beta-thalassemia chromosomes in the ethnic group. Nine different haplotypes were observed. Upon molecular cloning and partial DNA sequencing of one beta-gene from each of eight haplotypes and two from the ninth, seven different mutations were found. None of these have been identified in Mediterranean patients, even among the five haplotypes which appeared identical in the two groups. Asian Indian mutations included one nonsense and three frameshift mutations, one deletion affecting an acceptor splice site, and two mutations affecting a donor splice site. The correlation of a specific mutation with a specific haplotype was high but not invariant. Two mutations were associated with more than one haplotype but, in each instance, the mutation spread to a new haplotype could be explained most simply by recombination 5' to the beta-globin gene. In addition, four mutations, one reported here and three others previously reported, have been observed on two chromosome backgrounds that are identical except for the status of a polymorphic HinfI site 5' to the beta gene. This HinfI site does not show significant linkage disequilibrium with markers both 5' and 3' to it, suggesting that it lies within a region of relative sequence randomization.
