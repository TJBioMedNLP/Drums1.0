Desmoglein-2 and desmocollin-2 mutations in dutch arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomypathy patients: results from a multicenter study.
BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and type of mutations in the major desmosomal genes, Plakophilin-2 (PKP2), Desmoglein-2 (DSG2), and Desmocollin-2 (DSC2), in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) patients. We also aimed to distinguish relevant clinical and ECG parameters. METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical evaluation was performed according to the Task Force Criteria (TFC). We analyzed the genes in (a) 57 patients who fulfilled the ARVD/C TFC (TFC+), (b) 28 patients with probable ARVD/C (1 major and 1 minor, or 3 minor criteria), and (c) 31 patients with 2 minor or 1 major criteria. In the TFC+ ARVD/C group, 23 patients (40%) had PKP2 mutations, 4 (7%) had DSG2 mutations, and 1 patient (2%) carried a mutation in DSC2, whereas 1 patient (2%) had a mutation in both DSG2 and DSC2. Among the DSG2 and DSC2 mutation-positive TFC+ ARVD/C probands, 2 carried compound heterozygous mutations and 1 had digenic mutations. In probable ARVD/C patients and those with 2 minor or 1 major criteria for ARVD/C, mutations were less frequent and they were all heterozygous. Negative T waves in the precordial leads were observed more (P<0.002) among mutation carriers than noncarriers and in particular in PKP2 mutation carriers. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in DSG2 and DSC2 are together less prevalent (10%) than PKP2 mutations (40%) in Dutch TFC+ ARVD/C patients. Interestingly, biallelic or digenic DSC2 and/or DSG2 mutations are frequently identified in TFC+ ARVD/C patients, suggesting that a single mutation is less likely to cause a full-blown ARVD/C phenotype. Negative T waves on ECG were prevalent among mutation carriers (P<0.002).
