Neutrophil elastase gene variation and coronary heart disease.
AIMS: Identification and functional characterization of variants in the neutrophil elastase (ELA2) gene in cardiovascular disease. METHODS: From participants of the ECTIM (Etude Cas-Temoins sur l'infarctus du Myocarde) Study with myocardial infarction (MI) 2082 chromosomes were genetically scanned; 990 patients with MI and 904 controls were genotyped for the common polymorphisms G-761A and S173S (C4890A). Expression vectors for Ela2 variants were transiently transfected, followed by Northern and Western blot analyses. Promoter variants were analyzed by transfection/reporter gene assays. RESULTS: We identified 11 genetic variants, two in the 5'-flanking (G-761A, -852/del53 bp), six in exons (R49H, N81N, G93V, S173S, D222Y, P228L) and three in introns (C+29/in3T, C+149/in3T, C+137/in4T). In Belfast, 4890A allele carriers had a risk for MI with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.44 (95% CI 1.12-1.86; P=0.005), the OR for MI associated with the -761G/-4890A haplotype with reference to -761G/-4890C amounting to 2.38 (95% CI 1.23-4.57; P=0.01). Transcript or protein expression of both allelic constructs (4890A and 4890C) did not, however, differ. Conversely, transcriptional activity was significantly elevated (<35%) by -852/del53 bp in THP-1 monocytes compared with the nondeleted promoter (P=0.001); the deletion was observed in one patient with premature MI at the age of 28 years, whose mother had had an MI at the age of 48 years. CONCLUSIONS: The association of C4890A with MI in Belfast exclusively, and the presumed absence of its functionality, provides little support for a substantial implication of common ELA2 gene variants in overall MI risk. Whether -852/53del plays a role in cardiovascular pathophysiology or not should be evaluated further.
