Posttranslational modification of beta 141 Leu associated with the beta 75(E19)Leu-->Pro mutation in Hb Atlanta.
The recent report of the oxidation of beta 141 Leu in a New Zealand family with Hb Atlanta [ beta 75(E19)Leu-->Pro] prompted us to reinvestigate the original Hb Atlanta case from Georgia. Tryptic peptide maps showed that the modified beta CoT-14 peptide was present together with beta AT-14 in isopropanol precipitates of Hb Atlanta. Amino acid analysis confirmed that beta CoT-14 lacked leucine and mass spectrometry indicated that it had an increased mass of 16 Daltons. These findings support the proposition that the beta 75 Leu-->Pro substitution in the E helix is the direct cause of the beta 141 Leu oxidation.
