Hemoglobin Maputo: a new beta-chain variant (alpha 2 beta 2 47 (CD6) Asp replaced by Tyr) in combination with hemoglobin S, identified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
During a routine hematological investigation, a slowly-moving hemoglobin variant was detected in a 2-year-old child from Maputo (Mozambique) in combination with hemoglobin S. Structural studies carried out by HPLC demonstrated a previously unreported amino acid substitution, beta 47 (CD6) Asp replaced by Tyr. The new hemoglobin variant has been named hemoglobin Maputo.
