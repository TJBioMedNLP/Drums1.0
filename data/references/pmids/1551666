The molecular defect in a family with mild atypical osteogenesis imperfecta and extreme joint hypermobility: exon skipping caused by an 11-bp deletion from an intron in one COL1A2 allele.
We have investigated a family with an autosomal dominantly inherited connective-tissue defect causing extreme joint hypermobility, premature osteoporosis and late-onset fractures. Analysis of collagenous proteins from affected individuals showed a deletion in some alpha 2(I) chains. Peptide mapping localized this to the CB peptide alpha 2CB4, which covers the N-terminal one-third of the protein chain. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of cDNA derived from this region of the mRNA identified a heterozygous deletion of the 54 bp comprising exon 9. Similar analysis of the genomic DNA revealed an 11-bp deletion from bp3 to bp13 of IVS-9. This disrupts the consensus 5' splice signal (GTAAGT) and leads to exon skipping. In a family study of 13 affected and unaffected family members using both heteroduplex formation and direct analysis for the deletion, all of the affected, but no unaffected individuals, were found to carry the deletion. This generated a positive Lod score of 2.6 with the Liped programme.
