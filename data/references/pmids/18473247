THE Hb S/beta+ -thalassemia phenotype demonstrates that the IVS-I (-2) (A>C) mutation is a mild beta-thalassemia allele.
We report a family in which two siblings are compound heterozygotes for Hb S [beta6(A3)GluVal] and a rare beta-globin mutation [IVS-I (-2) (A>C)]. Both patients had significant levels of Hb A, indicating that the IVS-I (-2) mutation is a relatively mild beta(+)-thalassemia (beta(+)-thal) allele. This mutation, in compound heterozygosity with Hb S, does not necessarily lead to a mild clinical course.
