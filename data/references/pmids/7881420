Severe (type III) osteogenesis imperfecta due to glycine substitutions in the central domain of the collagen triple helix.
The molecular defects responsible for three cases of severe (type III) osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) were investigated. The mutation sites were localized in pro alpha 1(I) and pro alpha 2(I) mRNA molecules, respectively, by chemical cleavage of mismatch in heteroduplex nucleic acids. Mutation identification was achieved by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-DNA amplification, followed by cloning and sequencing. Two unrelated patients were demonstrated to bear the same G-A transition at nucleotide 2418 of the pro alpha 1(I) coding region, leading to G589S substitution and resulting in very similar clinical manifestations. In the latter patient, a G-T transversion at nucleotide 2166 was found in one pro alpha 2(I) allele, which caused a G586V substitution and again severe OI. Presumably all three mutations occurred de novo in the probands, since they were not found in their parents' DNA. The biochemical findings on type I collagen were very similar in all the probands: the mutations here described had little destabilizing effects on triple helix formation, secretion and stability. The half-life of the collagen incorporated into the insoluble matrix was comparable with that of controls. These mutations are localized in the gap zone of the fibrils where mineral nucleation occurs. This fact suggests that they probably do not exert destabilizing effects on the individual collagen molecules, but rather on the mineralization process, once the defective molecules are incorporated into the fibrils, hence causing severe phenotypes.
