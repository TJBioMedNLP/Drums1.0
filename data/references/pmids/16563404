Characterization of hemoglobin Wurzburg (alpha2beta2 4(A1)Thr-->Asn), a new electrophoretically silent variant, by mass spectrometry and molecular modeling studies.
The first hemoglobin (Hb) variant carrying a mutation at beta4 was identified as beta4(A1)Thr-->Asn or Hb Wurzburg and constituted 38% of the total hemoglobin. It showed a slightly elevated oxygen affinity and a slightly decreased cooperativity index (n50 = 2.3 versus n50 = 2.8). The analysis of the electrostatic potential showed an increased negative charge at the site of the mutation with a displacement of beta6(A3)Glu by 1.3A. The replacement of threonine by asparagine seems to stabilize the R conformation. This may explain partially both the high affinity and the reduction in cooperativity.
