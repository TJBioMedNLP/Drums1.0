Mutation analysis of the GJB2 (connexin 26) gene in Egypt.
Fifty to eighty percent of autosomal recessive deafness is due to mutations in the GJB2 gene encoding connexin 26. Among Caucasians, the c.35delG mutation in this gene accounts for up to 30 to 70% of all cases with early childhood deafness. In this study, we present the analysis of the GJB2 gene in 159 Egyptians from 111 families with non-syndromic mild to profound hearing impairment. An additional family with Vohwinkel syndrome, a combination of hearing impairment and palmoplantar keratoderma with constriction of the digits, was also included. We used direct sequencing analysis to detect all possible coding GJB2 variants in this population. The presence of the g.1777179_2085947del mutation (hereafter called del(GJB6-D13S1830)) was also investigated as it was shown to be the second most common mutation causing non-syndromic prelingual hearing impairment in Spain. Sequencing analysis of one randomly chosen individual per family revealed that the c.35delG mutation was present in 24 out of 222 chromosomes (10.8%), making it the most frequent mutation in the GJB2 gene in Egypt. Five other mutations were already described previously [p.Thr8Met, p.Val37Ile, p.Val153Ile, c.333_334delAA, c.1-3172G>A (commonly designated as IVS1+1G>A)]. This study also revealed three other novel gene variants resulting in amino acid substitutions (p.Phe142del, p.Asp117His, p.Ala148Pro). In contrast with most populations, the del(GJB6-D13S1830) mutation upstream of the GJB2 gene was not present in this Egyptian population. A dominant mutation at a highly conserved residue, p.Gly130Val, was found in the family with Vohwinkel syndrome.
