A new frameshift beta zero-thalassemia mutation (codons 27-28 +C) found in a Chinese family.
A new beta zero-thalassemia mutation, a frameshift mutation with an insertion of a single cytosine nucleotide in codon 27-28, is described. The propositus, who is compound heterozygous for this mutation and the IVSII-654 C----T beta zero-thalassemia mutation, has the phenotype of severe beta-thalassemia major.
