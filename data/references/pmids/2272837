Characterization of Hb Aalborg, a new unstable hemoglobin variant, by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry.
Hb Aalborg is a new unstable hemoglobin variant found in association with mild anemia. Heinz bodies were readily inducible in red cells but there was no specific evidence of hemolysis and the variant therefore appears to be without significant clinical effect. The amino acid replacement was identified by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and is that of Gly----Arg at position beta 74 (E18). Hb Aalborg is moderately unstable.
