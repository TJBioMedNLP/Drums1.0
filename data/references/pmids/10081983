Two hemoglobin variants with an alteration of the oxygen-linked chloride binding: Hb Antananarivo [alpha1(NA1)Val-->Gly] and Hb Barbizon [beta144(HC1)Lys-->Met].
We here report two new, clinically silent, hemoglobin variants in which the structural modification disturbs the oxygen-linked chloride binding. Hb Antananarivo [alpha1(NA1)Val-->Gly] was found during a systematic hematological study in a 24-year-old woman, who originates from Madagascar. Hb Barbizon [beta144 (HC1)Lys-Met] was found in several members of a French family. The oxygen binding properties of Hb Barbizon were similar to those of Hb Antananarivo showing, in vitro, a decreased chloride effect as compared to Hb A. In Hb Barbizon, the replacement of lysine beta144 by a methionine residue decreased from 4 to 2 the excess positive charges in the central cavity, thus leading to a reduction of about half of the chloride effect. For Hb Antananarivo, the mechanism is unclear since there is no difference in the number of positive charges in the central cavity but alterations are likely at the alpha1alpha2 interface.
