A novel mutation (967-970+2)delAAAGGT in the choroideremia gene found in a Japanese family and related clinical findings.
PURPOSE: To investigate the choroideremia (CHM) gene of one affected male and one obligate carrier in a Japanese family with choroideremia, and to characterize the related clinical features. METHODS: We examined one affected man and one carrier woman from a Japanese family. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of peripheral blood collected from the affected man and his daughter, who is an obligate carrier of choroideremia. Exons 1-15 of the CHM gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and directly sequenced. We performed ophthalmic examinations including best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, fundus examination, electroretinography, and Goldmann perimetry. RESULTS: A novel (967-970+2)delAAAGGT mutation was detected in the CHM gene. The affected man was hemizygous and had night-blindness, chorioretinal atrophy spreading from the posterior pole to the mid-periphery, and bareness of the sclera. His daughter was a heterozygous carrier who had chorioretinal atrophy and mottled appearance of the retinal pigment epithelium. CONCLUSION: A novel (967-970+2)delAAAGGT mutation existed in the CHM gene of a Japanese family with choroideremia.
