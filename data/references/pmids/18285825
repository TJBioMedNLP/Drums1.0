A mutational analysis of the SLC26A4 gene in Spanish hearing-impaired families provides new insights into the genetic causes of Pendred syndrome and DFNB4 hearing loss.
Pendred syndrome (PS) and DFNB4, a non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss with enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (EVA), are caused by mutations in the SLC26A4 gene. Both disorders are recessive, and yet only one mutated SLC26A4 allele, or no mutations, are identified in many cases. Here we present the genetic characterization of 105 Spanish patients from 47 families with PS or non-syndromic EVA and 20 families with recessive non-syndromic hearing loss, which segregated with the DFNB4 locus. In this cohort, two causative SLC26A4 mutations could be characterized in 18 families (27%), whereas a single mutated allele was found in a patient with unilateral hearing loss and EVA in the same ear. In all, 24 different causative mutations were identified, including eight novel mutations. The novel p.Q514K variant was the most prevalent mutation in SLC26A4, accounting for 17% (6/36) of the mutated alleles identified in this study, deriving from a founder effect. We also characterized a novel multiexon 14 kb deletion spanning from intron 3 to intron 6 (g.8091T_22145Cdel). This study also revealed the first case of a de novo recessive mutation p.Q413P causing PS that arose in the proband's paternal allele, the maternal one carrying the p.L445W. The relevance of our results for genetic diagnosis of PS and non-syndromic EVA hearing loss is discussed.
