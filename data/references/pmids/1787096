Hb Cleveland or alpha 2 beta 2(93)(F9)Cys----Arg;121(GH4)Glu----Gln.
Hb Cleveland is characterized by two amino acid substitutions, namely beta 121(GH4)Glu----Gln as in Hb D-Los Angeles and beta 93(F9)Cys----Arg as in Hb Okazaki, and shares with Hb Okazaki a decreased stability, an increase in oxygen affinity, and decreases in Bohr effect and heme-heme interaction. It is the 13th beta chain variant with two substitutions that has been described thus far.
