Multiexon deletion in the procollagen III gene is associated with mild Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV.
We have characterized a deletion of approximately 9 kilobases which spans from intron 33 to exon 48 of one pro-alpha 1 (III) collagen allele in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. The mutation results in the production of an in-frame species of mRNA which lacks the sequences corresponding to residues 595-1,008 of the triple-helical domain. Thus, half of the pro-alpha 1 (III) chains synthesized by the patient's fibroblasts are nearly 30% shorter than normal. The procollagen III molecules composed of either three normal length or three shortened chains are thermally stable and efficiently secreted. In contrast, the procollagen III molecules that contain one or two shortened chains are unstable and are not secreted. Failure to secrete unstable molecules and a residual functional role of the shortened but stable homotrimers may explain the somewhat milder phenotype of this individual compared with that of another Ehlers-Danlos type IV patient bearing a deletion of similar size in the amino-terminal portion of the alpha 1 (III) collagen chain.
