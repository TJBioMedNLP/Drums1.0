Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: yet another type?
A mother and her four children had gross generalized joint laxity, with multiple dislocations and subluxations, moderate skin hyperextensibility and mild connective tissue fragility. Their condition could be categorized in the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Type III or the familial undifferentiated hypermobility group of disorders, but differed from these conditions by virtue of the severity of articular complications and the presence of wormian bones in the skulls. We consider that these patients have an undelineated connective tissue disorder; attempts at characterization at the molecular level are underway.
