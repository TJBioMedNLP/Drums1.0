Variable hearing impairment in a DFNB2 family with a novel MYO7A missense mutation.
Myosin VIIA mutations have been associated with non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNB2; DFNA11) and Usher syndrome type 1B (USH1B). We report clinical and genetic analyses of a consanguineous Iranian family segregating autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL). The hearing impairment was mapped to the DFNB2 locus using Affymetrix 50K GeneChips; direct sequencing of the MYO7A gene was completed. The Iranian family (L-1419) was shown to segregate a novel homozygous missense mutation (c.1184G>A) that results in a p.R395H amino acid substitution in the motor domain of the myosin VIIA protein. As one affected family member had significantly less severe hearing loss, we used a candidate approach to search for a genetic modifier. This novel MYO7A mutation is the first reported to cause DFNB2 in the Iranian population and this DFNB2 family is the first to be associated with a potential modifier. The absence of vestibular and retinal defects, and less severe low frequency hearing loss, is consistent with the phenotype of a recently reported Pakistani DFNB2 family. Thus, we conclude this family has non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNB2) rather than USH1B, providing further evidence that these two diseases represent discrete disorders.
