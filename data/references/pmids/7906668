G6PD Ferrara I has the same two mutations as G6PD A(-) but a distinct biochemical phenotype.
The cloning and sequencing of the normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene has led to the study of the molecular defects that determine enzymatic variants. In this paper, we describe the mutations responsible for the Ferrara I variant in an Italian man with a family history of favism, from the Po delta. Nucleotide sequencing of this variant showed a G-->A mutation at nucleotide 202 in exon IV causing a Val-->Met amino acid exchange, and a second A-->G mutation at nucleotide 376 in exon V causing an Asn-->Asp amino acid substitution. Although on the basis of its biochemical properties this variant was classified as G6PD Ferrara I, it has the same two mutations as G6PD A(-), which is common in American and African blacks, and as the sporadic Italian G6PD Matera. The mutation at nucleotide 202 was confirmed by NlaIII digestion of a polymerase chain reaction amplified DNA fragment spanning 109 bp of exon IV. The 109-bp mutated amplified sequence is not distinguishable from the normal sequence in single strand conformation polymorphism analysis.
