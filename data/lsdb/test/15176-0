This is the home page for the FamilyJewels project at <a
href="http://www.caltech.edu/">Caltech</a>, where we are developing
tools for biologists to do comparisons of genomic DNA on the order of
10-100kb in length.

<p>
New users should start with the <a href="tutorial/">introduction to
doing comparative sequence analysis with FamilyRelations II</a>.
<p>
If you are interested in motif searching, the Cartwheel server now lets
users build position-weight matrices and search their own sequences with
them.  We have a short <a href='http://idyll.dreamhosters.com/transfer/motif-screencast-try3.mp4'>video demonstration (MP4 format)</a> of this functionality.

<p>
There are two example <a href="project/">class</a> <a href="project/sox2-motif-searching.html">projects</a> available for
people interested in using FRII for a genomics class.  They were both developed
for classes at Caltech.
<p>
<h4>Announcements:</h4>

<b><font color='red'>Methods paper.</font></b> A paper discussing techniques for cis-regulatory
bioinformatics is now available: <a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0091-679X(08)00218-5'>Computational Approaches to Finding and Analyzing cis-Regulatory Elements</a>.

<p>

<b>Software update.</b> There is a new version
of FamilyRelationsII that fixes one or two crashing bugs.
<a href="download.html">Go check it out!</a>  <font size=-1>-- August
26th, 2005</font>

<p>

A paper on FamilyRelationsII and
paircomp has been published: <i>Paircomp, FamilyRelationsII and Cartwheel: tools for interspecific sequence comparison.</i>
<a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/70/abstract">Get the
article at BMC Bioinformatics (Open Access)</a>.  <font size=-1>-- Mar 24, 2005</font>

<p>

<b>paircomp 1.0 released!</b> This release
makes the analysis functionality of paircomp completely available to
C++ and Python programmers.  <a href="./paircomp/">Read the docs and/or
download paircomp.</a> <font size=-1>-- Mar 22, 2005</font>

<p>

As of November 2004, Cartwheel/FRII <a href="update-nov-2004.html">can execute
and display Vista- and PipMaker-style comparisons</a>, in addition to the
regular dot-plot-style comparisons.


<p>
<h3>Software</h3>

<b>FamilyRelations II</b>, a.k.a <b>FRII</b>, is a graphical viewer
for analyses created using the <a
href="http://cartwheel.caltech.edu/"><b>Cartwheel analysis
server</b></a>.  FRII is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux;
you can <a href="download.html">download it here.</a>
<p>
The <b>paircomp toolkit</b> is a replacement for <b>SeqComp</b>; it
provides a C++ and Python interface to do fixed-width window analyses
of two DNA sequences.  You can read the documentation for paircomp
and download the toolkit <a href="./paircomp/">here</a>.
<p>

Both FRII and paircomp are actively maintained by <a
href="mailto:titus@caltech.edu">Titus Brown</a>, as part of his <a
href="http://www.idyll.org/~t/bio-tools/">tools for sequence
analysis</a>.

<h4>Related Projects:</h4>
<b>SeqComp</b> is the program originally used to run the comparisons
displayed by <b>FamilyRelations</b>; it was written by <b>Tristan De
Buysscher</b>.  Its functionality has since been integrated into
<a href="http://mussa.caltech.edu/"><b>Mussa</b></a>, Tristan's n-way sequence
comparison system.  SeqComp is still available but is not supported.

<p>

<b>FamilyRelations</b> is the Java/Jython predecessor to FamilyRelationsII.
It is no longer functional, but the source code is still available through
SourceForge.

<p>

Dr. Shoudan Liang, a physicist from NASA, wrote <b>find_patch</b>,
a version of SeqComp that is highly optimized for small windowsizes.
It is available but not supported; eventually, the optimizations will
be incorporated into the paircomp toolkit.

Laura Romano and Greg Wray used FamilyRelations and SeqComp to display
a comparison of the Endo16 cis-regulatory region done between two species
of sea urchin:
<blockquote>
<i>Conservation of Endo16 expression in sea urchins despite evolutionary divergence in both cis and trans-acting components of transcriptional regulation.</i><br>

One additional paper from the Cho Lab (frog-mouse comparison) has not yet

fixed-width window pairwise matches; you can download it <a
href="paircomp-theory.pdf">here</a>.

<h4>Old Software</h4>

SeqComp is written in C++ and should compile with any modern C++ compiler.
<p>
FamilyRelations is written in <a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a>,
