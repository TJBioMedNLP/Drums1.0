      <p><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><strong>Introduction</strong></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Solvent exposure 
        measures describe to what extent a residue in a protein interacts with 
        its surrounding solvent molecules and hence could provide important information 
        for understanding and predicting many aspects of protein structure and 
        function (Yuan and Huang, 2004; Hamelryck, 2005) and for identifying uncharacterized 
        evolutionary mechanism of novel protein folds from existing folds (Cordes 
        et al., 1999). In other investigations, the solvent accessibility has 
        been successfully utilized to improve the prediction of flexible/rigid 
        residues (Schlessinger et al., 2006) and DNA-binding residues (Ofran et 
        al., 2007) in proteins. Therefore, knowledge of solvent exposure is of 
        great biological importance, which is not only useful for predicting structural 
        and functional features of proteins and predicting the three-dimensional 
        structures of proteins, but also helpful for our deep understanding of 
        the sequence-structure-function relationship.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the last 
        two decades, several solvent exposure measures have been developed, for 
        example, solvent accessible surface area (ASA) (Connolly, 1983; Miller 
        et al., 1987), relative accessible surface area (rASA) (Rost and Sander, 
        1994), residue depth (RD) (Chakravarty and Varadarajan, 1999), and contact 
        number (CN) (Nishikawa and Ooi, 1980; Pollastri et al., 2001). Despite 
        their contributive knowledge provided by these solvent exposure measures, 
        they all have some intrinsic drawbacks. For example, it is impossible 
        to apply ASA measure to determine to what extent a residue is buried, 
        or it is difficult to distinguish a deeply buried residue from a partially 
        buried residue, while for these two kinds of residues their ASA values 
        would be zeros or close to zeros. In the case of RD measure, it is difficult 
        to compare residues with different sizes and calculating RD suffers from 
        high computational complexity and inefficiency. While in the case of CN 
        measure, it could only provide a rather coarse-grained and insensitive 
        illustration of a residue's solvent exposure, in comparison with ASA 
        and RD.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In this context, 
        half-sphere exposure (HSE) defined by Hamelryck is a new kind of two-dimensional 
        solvent exposure measure (Hamelryck, 2005), which is of particular interest 
        in this study. Compared with other solvent exposure measures, HSE has 
        a superior performance with respect to protein stability, conservation 
        among different folds, computational speed and predictability (Hamelryck, 
        2005). HSE separates a residue's sphere into two half spheres: HSE-up 
        corresponds to the upper sphere in the direction of the chain side of 
        the residue, while HSE-down points to the lower sphere in the direction 
        of the opposite side. As the two half spheres described by HSE-up and 
        HSE-down are distinct in terms of geometry and energy, they possess different 
        interesting properties that are related to the characterization of the 
        residue's spatial neighborhood. Hence, this new measure holds advantageous 
        potentials that can be applied in many aspects of protein structure studies.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">However, it 
        is not clear so far to what extent HSE can predicted from protein sequences. 
        In this article, we propose a novel approach to quantify the HSE-sequence 
        relationship and predict the HSE measures from protein primary sequences 
        based on support vector regression (SVR). As an implementation of our 
        method, we (cooperated with <a href="http://sysman.net.au">melbourne web design</a> company) have created a publicly available webserver called HSEpred 
        to facilitate the HSE prediction. This webserver allows users to perform 
        rapid exploratory analysis of protein sequences of their interest. It 
        allows users to submit a protein sequence in the FASTA format and select 
        one of the three models derived from three sequence encoding schemes to 
        predict the HSE-up, HSE-down and CN values for all residues in the query 
        sequence.</font><br>
