<p><strong>People.sissa.it</strong> is the 
    domain for staff and student personal home pages; once you have 
    <a href="http://sis.sissa.it/on-line_resources/faq/publichtml_page">created a home page</a>,
    you can view it by typing <strong>http://people.sissa.it/~username/</strong> 
    <em>(where username is your username)</em> in the Address/Location box on your
    browser.</p>

<p>Please note that, following a change in the computing policy, the old domain naming for staff/student pages (www.sissa.it/~username/)
    will not work. It is recommended that all staff and students use the new domain
    <strong>people.sissa.it/~username/</strong>. Be sure to use the
    new address when creating links or referring people to your web page.</p>

<p>See the <a href="pages.php"><b>list of all personal home pages</b></a> for a list of all staff and student home pages at SISSA.</p>

<p>As a <a href="http://sis.sissa.it/services/accounts/getting_an_account">registered user</a> of the <a href="http://sis.sissa.it/">SISSA domain</a>,
    you can <a href="http://sis.sissa.it/on-line_resources/faq/publichtml_page">create 
    and publish your own personal home page</a> on the Web in your filespace on 
    the Central File Server; the simplest way to do this is to run the <a href="http://sis.sissa.it/on-line_resources/faq/publichtml_page"><b>sissa-mkhome</b></a>
    command on the <a href="http://sis.sissa.it/services/computing/computing_resources">Common Access server</a>: this creates a basic home page (with your
    name and e-mail address) which will automatically be added to the <a href="pages.php"><b>list of all personal
    home pages</b></a> the next day. You can <a href="http://sis.sissa.it/on-line_resources/faq/publichtml_page">edit
    your home page</a> and <strong>view it</strong> by typing the address or URI 
    (Uniform Resource Indicator) in the Address/Location box on your browser. If 
    you have need to develop your site, eg for group project work, you may need 
    to check your <a href="quota.php">disk space quota</a> and shared disk space.
    In case of need you can install the <a href="http://www.sissa.it/download/ca/sissa-ca.cer">SISSA Root Certificate</a>.</p>

<p>The content and design of your personal home page area is up to you, but you 
    must keep in mind that you are personally responsible for the content: you 
    must ensure that you abide by the <a href="http://sis.sissa.it/sissanetcomppolicy">SISSA Network
    computing policy</a>. In particular, your home page <b>must not</b>:</p>

<ul>
    <li>be used for illegal purposes</li>
    <li>include threatening, obscene, or harassing materials or be used to harm others</li>
    <li>be used for the benefit of third parties or for-profit activities without authorisation</li>
    <li>infringe the rights of other members of the school</li>
    <li>create heavy network traffic that disrupts or interferes with the normal activities of the school</li>
    <li>appropriate other people's intellectual property rights</li>
</ul>

<p>If a user complains about the content of your pages you may be asked to remove 
    the offending content and, if you do not comply, your page may be shut down 
    permanently.</p> 

<h4>Getting Help</h4>
<p> If you have technical problems with your personal home page, please use the
    <a href="http://www.sissa.it/contact/helpdesk">SISSA Helpdesk</a> contact form.
    Please note however, that you are responsible for learning to write your own
    Web pages and <b>support is not available for this</b>.
    See this <a href="http://www.html.net/tutorials/html/"><b>HTML Tutorial</b></a> for help on writing for the Web.</p>

<h4>Remember:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>many people will visit your home page - be sure to include an e-mail option 
	so that visitors can comment/provide feedback on your page.</li>
    <li>consider whether you want to include images of yourself or your home address/phone 
	number on your home page - incidents of harrassment do occur.</li>
    <li>never include an image of someone else without their permission and knowledge.</li>
    <li>personal home pages<em> remain on the system only while the provider is 
	a registered user</em> - if your home page proves popular (see <a href="https://people.sissa.it/usage/">Usage Statistics</a>),
	try to ensure that you provide a forwarding address or alternative web address when you leave the school.</li>
    <li>check your pages regularly to ensure that the information in them is up-to-date 
	and that existing links are still valid.</li>
</ul>
