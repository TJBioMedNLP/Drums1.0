      Group I intron sequence and structure Database (GISSD) is a specialized and comprehensive database for group I introns, focusing on integrating useful group I intron information from all available databases. GISSD also wants to provide de novo data essential for understanding group I introns at a systematic level. It aims to provide a consensus structure for each subgroup of group I introns based on high quality alignments, to judge the confidence of the group I introns annotated by Rfam (<A href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/</A>), to classify Rfam group I introns into subgroups based on the consensus structures, and to provide intron number-containing taxonomy tree based on the taxonomy information of the host organisms of all group I introns. 
     <BR><BR>
     Currently, GISSD presents 1789 intron complete records, including the nucleotide sequence of each annotated intron plus 15 nt of the upstream and downstream exons, as well as the pseudoknots-containing secondary structure predicted by integrating comparative sequence analysis and minimal free energy algorithms. These introns represent all 13 known minor subgroups and an undifferentiated major subgroup, with their structure-based alignments being separately provided. Both structure predictions and alignments were done manually and iteratively adjusted, which yielded reliable consensus structure for each subgroup allowing us to judge the confidence of 20,085 group I introns previously predicted by INFERNAL program (<A href="http://infernal.janelia.org/">http://infernal.janelia.org/</A>), and to classify these large amount of introns into subgroups automatically. The database provides the intron-associated taxonomy information from GenBank, allowing one to detailedly view the distribution of all group I introns. CDSs residing in introns and 3-D structure information are also integrated if available. A total number of 16914 group I introns were validated, with 95.5% of them being classified into IC3 subgroup and 96.4% residing in viridiplantae, suggesting that the major reservoir of group I introns in nature is the chloroplast tRNALeu genes.

Group I introns are highly diverse in their sizes ranging from less than 200 nt to over 4000 nt. These introns are also featured by weak sequence similarity and contain two long-range pseudoknots. These features make it difficult for current computational programs to automatedly generate the reliable secondary structure and alignments of group I introns. CITRON (<A HREF="#Lisacek">Lisacek et al.,
1994</A>) and Infernal (<A HREF="#Griffiths-Jones">Griffiths-Jones et al., 2003</A>) have been successfully used to identify group I introns from genome sequences. However, the sensitivity and specificity of both programs are not satisfied for introns whose characteristics are not integrated into the program or not included in the training dataset. Furthermore, identification of an intron doesn't mean that the structure of the intron is well determined. We have used manual methods to provide reliable detailed secondary structures and alignments for near 1800 group I introns belonging to 13 subgroups, and made each of them available on GISSD. These data could be used to build better models or as a more complete training datasets to improve the future search of new group I introns or prediction of the intron structures.

        <P class="justify">In general, phylogenetic trees of group I introns are
	inferred by inputting the core region alignments to phylogeny
	programs. The reliability of the alignment would affect the
	results and reasoning of the phylogeny analysis. On the other

	interactions. Reliable secondary structure for all the
	subgroups also allows depicting the structural function of
	peripheral elements.
	<BR><BR> 
	We deduced a consensus structure for each of the 14 subgroups according to the alignments of the 1789 group I introns.  The consensus structures were then processed by program 'cmbuild' in INFERNAL package and we got 14 Covariance Models (CM is a type of profile stochastic context-free grammar (profile SCFG)) (<A HREF="#Eddy">Eddy and Durbin, 2002</A>). These CMs could be used to automatically search group I introns, to predict secondary structures (rough structures needed to be processed and validated), and to classify introns into subgroups.

      Group I introns are widespread non-coding RNA sequences found in nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial genomes of eukaryotes, in bacterial archaebacterial and eubacterial genomes, and even in some viral genomes. They are well known for self-splicing of their own from the host precursor RNA via two transesterification
  reactions, and therefore called group I ribozymes (<A HREF="#Cech">Cech,
  1990</A>). Comparative sequence analysis reveals a common secondary
  structure of all group I introns that consists conserved base paired
  elements designed as P1-P9 (<A HREF="#Burke">Burke, <EM>et al.</EM>, 1987</A>; <A HREF="#Michel">Michel and Westhof,
  1990</A>; <A HREF="#Li">Li and Zhang, 2005</A>). However, but P2 was latter found not
  present in some group I introns, and P10 containing the 3' splice

  </P>

  <P class="justify">
  Structural and Biochemical study has revealed that the active
  structure of group I ribozyme is assembled by two separable domains,
  i.e. P4-P6 domain containing P4, P5 and P6 and P3-P9 domain containing
  P3, P7, P8 and P9 (<A HREF="#Michel">Michel and Westhof, 1990</A>; <A HREF="#Tanner_a">Tanner, <EM>et al.</EM>, 1997a</A> and
  <A HREF="#Tanner_b">1997b</A>; <A HREF="#Golden98">Golden, <EM>et al.</EM>, 1998</A>; <A HREF="#Woodson">Woodson 2005</A>). In addition to these
  conserved core structural helices, group I introns have at least one
  additional peripheral base-paired structure, such as P2.1, P5abc, P9.1
  and P9.2 (<A HREF="#Michel">Michel and Westhof, 1990</A>). Peripheral elements establish a
  variety of tertiary interactions that play important and sometimes
  essential roles in organizing the P4-P6 and P3-P9 domains to the
  compact active structure (<A HREF="#Doherty">Doherty and Doudna, 2001</A>; <A HREF="#Xiao05">Xiao <EM>et al.</EM>,

     Splicing of group I introns is processed by two sequential
  ester-transfer reactions. The exogenous guanosine or guanosine
  nucleotide (exoG) first docks onto the active G-binding site located
  in P7, and its 3'-OH is aligned to attack the phosphorester bond at
  the 5' splice site located in P1, resulting in a free 3'-OH group at
  the upstream exon and the exoG being attached to the 5' end of the
  intron. Then the terminal G (omega G) of the intron swaps the exoG and
  occupy the G-binding site to organize the second ester-transfer
  reaction, the 3' OH group of the upstream exon in P1 is aligned to
  attacks the 3' splice site in P10, leading to the ligation the
  adjacent upstream and downstream exons and free of the catalytic
  intron. 

Following its excision from the pre-rRNA, group I intron undergoes an intramolecular cyclization reaction. This reaction is also self-catalyzed by transesterification, with the 3'-terminal G-OH of the RNA attacking of phosphorus atom located near the 5' end of the molecule. Both the 5' and 3' splice site phosphodiester bonds of group I intron precursor are unusually susceptible to slow hydrolysis, producing 5'-phosphate and 3'-hydrolysis termini. Site specific hydrolysis is thought to reflect the ability of the folded RNA structure to activate the splice-site phosphates or the incoming nucleophile, using the catalytic mechanism similar to that of self-splicing
       (<A HREF="#Cech">Cech, 1990</A>).

  Since early 1990s, the community started to study how group I intron
  achieves its native structure in vitro, and some mechanisms of RNA
  folding has been appreciated thus far. It is agreed that the
  tertiary structure is folded after the formation of the secondary
  structure (<A HREF="#Brion">Brion and Westhof, 1997</A>). During folding, RNA molecules
  are rapidly populated into different folding intermediates, the
  intermediates containing native interactions are further folded into
  the native structure through a fast folding pathway, while those
  containing non-native interactions are trapped metastable or stable
  non-native conformations, and the process of conversion to the
  native structure occurs very slowly (<A HREF="#Thirumalai">Thirumalai <EM>et al.</EM>, 2001</A>). It is
  evident that group I introns differing in the set of peripheral
  element display different potentials in entering the fast folding
  pathway. Meanwhile, cooperative assembly of the tertiary structure
  is important for folding of the native structure (<A HREF="#Treiber">Treiber and
  Williamson, 2001</A>; <A HREF="#Xiao03">Xiao <EM>et al.</EM>, 2003</A>; <A HREF="#Rangan">Rangan et al., 2003</A>; <A HREF="#Chauhan">Chauhan et
  al., 2005</A>). Nevertheless, folding of group I introns in vitro
  encounters both thermodynamic and kinetic challenges (<A HREF="#Treiber99">Treiber and
  Williamson, 1999</A>; <A HREF="#Treiber01">2001</A>). A few RNA binding proteins and chaperones
  have been shown to promote the folding of group I introns in vitro
  and in bacteria by stabilizing the native intermediates or
  structure, and by destabilizing the non-native structures,
  respectively (reviewed by <A HREF="#Schroeder">Schroeder <EM>et al.</EM>, 2004</A>).

Group I introns are distributed in bacteria, lower eukaryotes and higher plants. However, their occurence in bacteria seems to be more sporadic than in lower eukaryotes, and they become prevalent in higher plants. The genes that group I introns interrupt differ significantly: They interrupte rRNA, mRNA and tRNA genes in bacterial genomes, as well as in mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes of lower ukaryotes, but only invade rRNA genes in the nuclear genome of lower eukaryotes. In higher plants, these introns seem to be restricted to a few tRNA and mRNA genes of the chloroplasts and mitochondria.
  Both intron-early and intron-late theories have found evidences in
  explaining the origin of group I introns (<A HREF="#Haugen">Haugen <EM>et al.</EM>, 2005</A>). Some
  group I introns encode homing endonuclease (HEG), which catalyzes
  intron mobility. It is proposed that HEGs move the intron from one
  location to another, from one organism to another and thus account
  for the wide spreading of the selfish group I introns. It is true
  that no biological role has been identified for group I introns thus
  far except for splicing of themselves from the precursor to prevent
  the death of the host that they live by. A small number of group I
  introns are also found to encode a class of proteins called
  maturases that facilitate the intron splicing (<A HREF="#Lambowitz">Lambowitz <EM>et al.</EM>,
  1999</A>).
