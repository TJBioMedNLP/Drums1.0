		<img src="/Groups/images/logo_goa.gif" class="grouplogo" /> The UniProtKB-GOA project aims to provide high-quality Gene Ontology (GO) annotations to proteins in the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) and International Protein Index (IPI) and is a central dataset for other major multi-species databases; such as Ensembl and NCBI.
<br /><br />
UniProtKB-GOA has been a member of the GO Consortium <http://www.geneontology.org/> 
since 2001, and is responsible for the integration and release of GO annotations to the human, chicken and cow proteomes. Because of the multi-species nature of the UniProtKB, UniProtKB-GOA also assists in the curation of another 200,000 species. This involves electronic annotation and the integration of high-quality manual GO annotation from all GO Consortium model organism groups and specialist groups. This effort ensures that the UniProtKB-GOA dataset remain a key reference and a comprehensive source of GO annotation for all species.
<br /><br />

<br>

<br>
We are pleased to announce an additional set of GO annotations available in this release that have been automatically generated from the Molecular Function (MF) -> Biological Process (BP) inter-ontology relationships present in the GO OBO v1.2 format.
<br>

<br>
As many GO users do not currently reason over the GO inter-ontology relationships, a set of inferred annotations has been generated to improve the consistency of the Biological Process annotation set. These GO annotations are produced when an annotation has been made (either manually or electronically) to a Molecular Function term that, either directly or via one of its parent terms, has a relationship to a Biological Process term and where the Process term (or one of its children) has not already been used in the annotation set for the same gene product identifier. This inferred annotation set applies the same gene product identifier, reference and evidence code as the asserted function annotation and are generated from all sources of GO annotations, with only 'NOT'-qualified annotations being excluded. All such inferred GO annotations can be identified by the 'GOC' value in the 'assigned_by' field (column 15).

			<td valign="top">GOA proteomes files are now created using UniProtKB proteome data
<br>

<br>
As of this latest release, UniProtKB-GOA are creating the proteomes gene association files using the UniProtKB proteomes data. The UniProtKB-GOA proteomes files are available here: <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/proteomes.html">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/proteomes.html</a>
<br>

<br>
The proteome sets provided by UniProtKB-GOA were previously based on those defined by the Integr8 project. Integr8 is planning to close after the launch of Ensembl Genomes as the next-generation interface for genome-scale data from non-vertebrate species. UniProtKB is taking over responsibility for the maintenance of the complete proteome sets, which can be found here: <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/complete-proteomes">http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/complete-proteomes</a>
<br>

<br>
There are two main consequences that should be noted:
<br>
1) The proteomes are available only for those species that have a complete genome, as defined by INSDC. For the complete genomes, please see <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/genomes">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/genomes</a> and the NCBI Project database, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=genomeprj">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=genomeprj</a>
<br>
2) The entries within the proteome are the direct translation of the sequenced reference genome; this logic is applied to all species. Any species-specific rules that Integr8 used have not been propagated to the new sets. The proteome sets are subsets of the GOA-UniProt gene association file, and consequently if a protein accession is deemed not to be present in a particular proteome then any manual annotations made to this protein will not be visible in the proteome set; they will, however, still be available from the GOA-UniProt gene association file.

                              We are pleased to announce that this release of UniProtKB-GOA gene association files includes manual annotations from the GO Consortium Reference Genome project. GO terms based on experimental data from the scientific literature are used to annotate ancestral genes in phylogenetic trees from the PANTHER database (<a href="http://www.pantherdb.org">http://www.pantherdb.org</a>) by sequence similarity (evidence code ISS), and unannotated descendants of these ancestral genes are inferred to have inherited these same GO annotations by descent. The annotations are created using a tool called PAINT (Phylogenetic Annotation and INference Tool). <br />
