<h3>Abstract</h3>

<h4>Methods:</h4>
A new method was developed for identifying novel transcription factor regulatory targets based on calculating Local Affinity Density. Techniques from the signal-processing field were used, in particular the Hann digital filter, to calculate the relative binding affinity of different regions based on previously published <i>in vitro</i> binding data. To illustrate this approach, the complete genomes of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and <i>D. pseudoobscura</i> were analyzed for binding sites of the homeodomain protein Tinman, an essential heart development gene in both <i>Drosophila</i> and mouse. The significant binding regions were identified relative to genomic background and assigned to putative target genes. Valid candidates common to both species of <i>Drosophila</i> were selected as a test of conservation.

<h4>Results:</h4>
The new method was more sensitive than cluster searches for conserved binding motifs with respect to positive identification of known Tinman targets. Our Local Affinity Density method also identified a significantly greater proportion of Tinman-coexpressed genes than equivalent, optimized cluster searching. In addition, this new method predicted a significantly greater than expected number of genes with previously published RNAi phenotypes in the heart.
