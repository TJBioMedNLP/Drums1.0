<h1>drCCA: dimensionality reduction with Canonical Correlation Analysis</h1>

<hr>
<p>
<b>Brief summary:</b>
drCCA is a simple, efficient, and completely linear data fusion tool
based on canonical correlation analysis.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Integration of multiple information sources is an increasingly
important task in bioinformatics applications. Understanding,
predicting or already efficiently exploring the cellular mechanisms
requires information from several sources, such as gene expression,
protein concentrations or transcription factor binding. Combining data
sources, that can in general have very different forms of
representations, is a non-trivial problem, but already partial
solutions are useful. Combining several sources is advantageous also
when using just one type of data, because it reduces the noise which
is often a significant issue in biological experiments that have high
dimensionality but relatively few samples.
</p>

<p>
We offer a simple tool for combining several data sources with
co-occurring samples into a one vectorial data set of low
dimensionality. The method is motivated through bioinformatics
applications, but is generally usable for data fusion tasks in other
fields as well. The method aims to retain the variation that is shared
between the original data sources, while reducing the dimensionality
by ignoring variation that is specific to any of the data sources
alone. It is assumed that such variation is either noise or at least
less interesting as it is related to a phenomenom not visible in the
other sources, despite those containing measurements of the
exact same objects.
</p>

<p>
The drCCA method is based on utilizing the generalized canonical
correlation analysis to perform a linear projection on the collection
data sets. As the method is completely linear it is fast to
compute for large data sets, making genome-wide fusion possible.
The package includes regularization and tools for selecting
the final dimensionality of the combined data set automatically.

<h2>Package:</h2> 
<p>
The drCCA software package runs under <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a>,
a free language and environment for statistical computing. The latest version (currently 2.6.0) is recommended, but the package should work also with older version.</p>
