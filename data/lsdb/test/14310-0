<h1>Discourse and Truth: the Problematization of Parrhesia. </h1>

<h5>" <em>My intention was not to deal with the problem of truth, but
with the problem of truth-teller or truth-telling as an activity. By
this I mean that, for me, it was not a question of analyzing the
internal or external criteria that would enable the Greeks and Romans,
or anyone else, to recognize whether a statement or proposition is true
or not. At issue for me was rather the attempt to consider
truth-telling as a specific activity, or as a role. </em>"&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Discourse
&amp; Truth</em>, Concluding remarks by Foucault.</h5>

<h5>Ed. by Joseph Pearson in 1985 :" The text was compiled from
tape-recordings made of six lectures delivered, in English, by Michel
Foucault at the University of California at Berkeley in the Fall Term
of 1983. The lectures were given as part of Foucault's seminar,
entitled "Discourse and Truth". Since Foucault did not write, correct,
or edit any part of the text which follows, it lacks his imprimatur and
does not present his own lecture notes. What is given here constitutes
only the notes of one of his auditors. Altough the present text is
primarily a verbatim transcription of the lectures, repetitive
sentences or phrases have been eliminated, responses to questions have
been incorparated, whenever possible, into the lectures themselves, and
numerous sentences have been revised , all in the hope of producing a
more readable set of notes."<br>
Reed. 1999 : Transcripted for web from photocopies, the footnotes and
bibliography added by J.Pearson are missing.<br>
Reed. 2006: Some Greek quotes added, reorganisation into 6 files and
formatting. </h5>
