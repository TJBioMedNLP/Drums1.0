Welcome to the Silverman Lab! We are researchers who are interested in developing, characterizing, and applying DNA as a catalyst. We use techniques and concepts from chemical biology, organic chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, and other disciplines to design our experiments and interpret our results. Please visit our <a href="research/">Research</a> and <a href="publications/">Publications</a> pages for more information about our laboratory's activities. Please visit our <a href="people/">People</a> page to learn more about our laboratory's members.
