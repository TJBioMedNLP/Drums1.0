FT-COMAR implements a heuristic procedure for recovering a set of 3D
	 coordinates from an incomplete contact map (<a href="#references">Vassura et
	 al. 2007 a, b</a>). The algorithm is in two phases. The first
	 phase consists of the partially random prediction of a set of
	 starting coordinates. This initial phase relies essentially
	 on the metric matrix embedding algorithm (<a href="#references">Havel, 1998</a>). The
	 second phase of the algorithm iteratively applies a
	 correction/perturbation procedure to the randomly generated
	 set of coordinates. This is performed in order to obtain a
	 new set of coordinates as consistent as possible with the
	 given contact map. The refinement applies until the set of
	 coordinates is consistent with the given contact map or until
	 some control parameter reaches the stop condition. After that
	 the current version of FT-COMAR applies a
	 correction-perturbation procedure to ensure that the
	 following constraints, known to be true for all existing
	 proteins, are respected:
<ul><li>Distance(i, i+1) < 4 &Aring; for each Calpha atom i;</li>
<li>Distance(i, j) > 3,5 &Aring; for each pair of Calpha atoms i and
	 j.</li>
</ul>
	 Since a
	 blurred contact map can eventually be not physical (i.e. not
	 consistent with any set of 3D coordinates),
	 the quality of the solution found by FT-COMAR is highly
	 influenced by the correctness of the input contact map. To
	 improve the reconstruction it can be sometimes useful to mark
	 as unknown some (possibly) highly unsafe areas of the input
	 contact map. FT-COMAR does not consider the coordinates
	 points related to unknown entries during the refinement
	 phase. This has the effect to eventually avoid the
	 propagation of errors. 
<br/><br/>
<H3 id="usage">Usage</H3>
The FT-COMAR implementation available here takes as input
	 a symmetric contact map matrix where contacts are denoted
	 with 1 entries, non-contact are denoted with 0 entries and
	 unknown entries are denoted with -1. Such contact map may be
	 computed with any threshold value, even if previous results
	 show that higher thresholds allow the contact map to carry
	 more information (<a href="#references">Vassura et al. 2007 a</a>). 
Marking unsafe areas as unknown (-1 entry in the contact map) improves
	 reconstruction quality. For further improvement a simple
	 filtering procedure is provided: it can be used to detect
	 (and mark with -1) possibly unsafe entries of the input
	 contact map. This filtering procedure is based on the common
	 neighbors property of contact maps at threshold 12 &Aring; (see <a
	 href="index.html#filter">Filtered Reconstruction</a>),
	 so it has better performances when the input contact map
	 threshold is 12 &Aring;.
FT-COMAR has been tested, obtaining structures with RMSD from the
	 native on average less than 4 &Aring;, with:
<ul>
<li>thresholds in the range between 7 and 18 &Aring;;</li>
<li>    proteins having between 55 and 786 residues;</li>
<li>     number of errors in the range between 0 and 10% of the whole
contact map (threshold 12, see <a href="index.html#exp">Experimental Results</a>)</li>

<H3 id=err>Error generation</h3>

Errors are generated by flipping
the entry of randomly chosen rows and columns of the contact map. To introduce x%
errors we generate x errors for each
100 couples of residues.
To study how protein 3D structure can be
reconstructed with our algorithm from faulty contact maps we introduce three
classes errors. Examples of 15% errors of each type are shown below.

the behavior of COMAR with faulty contact maps. We perform tests by introducing
from 1% up to 10% random errors of class Err. The average RMSD of the
reconstruction from those faulty contact maps is shown in Fig. 2. The results
indicate that the quality of the protein 3D structure reconstruction depends on
the protein size: proteins with less than 150 residues are reconstructed with a

for small percentages of errors including 1% errors. Note that the sheer number

random errors for a protein of size 100 means 450 errors, while 1% random errors
for a protein of size 400 means 798 errors.</span></p>

<!--
<p class=p1a><span lang=EN-US>We analyze how the reconstruction quality varies
among SCOP categories with the aim of highlighting whether some categories can
be reconstructed better than others. In Fig. 3 we show how reconstruction
quality varies for different SCOP categories when we introduce 5% random
errors. As shown in Fig. 1, the mean RMSD from the native structure increases
proportionally to protein size, with some exceptions. The most notable
exception is the CDK4/6 inhibitory protein p18INK4c (1ihb chain A; (size 156)
that is in the SCOP Alpha+Beta category. It appears (Fig. 3) that exceptions to
the length dependent behavior of the quality of the reconstruction are rare and

<p class=p1a><span lang=EN-US>distributed among SCOP categories so that it
cannot be concluded that one SCOP category is more difficult to be
reconstructed from faulty contact maps than another.</span></p>

<p class=p1a><span lang=EN-US>We analyze how different types of errors
influence the quality of reconstruction. In particular, in Fig. 4, we compare
the performance of COMAR on the three classes of errors Err, Err-0 (errors on
non-contacts), Err-1 (errors on contacts) introduced in Section 3.2. As shown
in Fig. 4, on the average, for COMAR is better to deal with Err-1 errors than
with Err-0 errors. For example, we can see that contact maps with 50% errors on
contacts are reconstructed with the same quality of contact maps having 1% errors
on non-contacts (which means about 10% extra contacts).</span></p>

that most exceptions belong to the All-Alpha SCOP structural
category. This may be due to the fact that in such category most
contacts are located at very short sequence separations, causing more
difficulties in the reconstruction of the overall structure.

<H3 id=skip>Reconstruction From Incomplete Contact Maps</h3>


<!--
<p class=p1a><span lang=EN-US>Our tests give some clues on how the quality of
the prediction of contact maps could influence the reconstruction phase. This
is much more evident if we analyze the reconstruction quality of FT-COMAR on
faulty contact maps assuming to have a perfect filtering procedure, i.e. a
procedure which is able to detect all errors on faulty contact maps. To test
this approach we generate random incomplete contact maps by randomly choosing a
column and a row of the contact map and marking that entry, corresponding to a
detected error, as not safe (to be not considered during the reconstruction
routine). As shown in Fig. 5, FT-COMAR with perfect filtering can skip up to
75% of the contact map area and still compute a reconstructed 3D structure
which is endowed with a RMSD &lt; 4 &Aring; from the native structure. Furthermore
this reconstruction quality is independent of the protein size. This unexpected
result is due to the fact that FT-COMAR does not consider skipped entries in
the refinement phase (see Section 2.2 for the description of the algorithm). In
this way FT-COMAR does not uses wrong information during the refinement phase
avoiding the propagations of errors. The drawback is that this is true only
assuming that the remaining entries of the contact map are correct, i.e. only
in presence of a perfect filtering. As shown in Fig. 6, even if we skip only
25% of the entries, the reconstruction quality is rapidly decreasing at the
increasing of errors on the remaining 75% of the map. Again note that in this
case the reconstruction quality depends on the length of the protein. We can
interpret these results as an evidence of the fact that the quality of the
reconstruction is negatively influenced by the erroneous predictions of some
contacts more than by ignoring a consistent subset of contacts during the
reconstruction.</span></p>

<h3 id=filter>Error Filter Preprocessing</h3>

<!--
<p class=p1a><span lang=EN-US>The experimental results in Section 3.4 show that
we can reconstruct with much more reliability the 3D structure of a protein if
we are able to predict which areas of the contact map are unsafe. This suggests
that prediction quality is more important than quantity of contacts predicted:
for instance, comparing Fig. 2 and Fig. 5 it is evident that it is better to
predict 25% of the contact map with no errors than 100% of the contact map with
5% errors. This holds especially for proteins with a high number of residues.
At the present time there is no way to predict contact maps with high reliability.
Labeling unsafe contact map areas seems therefore an alternative way out to
find possible solutions. There are various properties that can be implemented to
test the safeness of contact map areas, from physical constraints to graph
properties. Here we propose a simple filtering procedure based on the so called
second connectivity property, namely the number of common contacts of two
contact nodes in the undirected graph (contact map) and we analyze how this
procedure improves the prediction of our algorithm on faulty contact maps. The
second connectivity property roughly assumes that two residues <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>i,j</i> are in contact if and only if they
share a high number of neighbors, i.e. there is a high number of residues which
are close to both <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>i</i> and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>j</i>. Experimentally, in our dataset of
1760 non-redundant protein chains only the 6% of residues which are in contact
share less than 10 neighbors and just the 0.7% of residues which are not in
contact share more that 18 neighbors. Thus our second connectivity filtering
procedure skips contact <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>i,j</i> if:</span></p>
-->

<p>Given the good <a href="#skip">results obtained when some areas of the contact map are
not considered</a> we improve reconstruction preprocessing the contact
map in order to identify (and not consider) "unsafe" areas. The simple
filter we implemented skips contact <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>i,j</i> if:</span></p>

M[<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

are in contact) and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>i</i>, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>j</i> share less than 10 neighbors, i.e.
residue <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>i</i> is in contact with less
than 10 residues which are in contacts also with residue <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>j</i>;</li>

<li>M[<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>i</i>, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>j</i>]=0 (<i

are not in contact) and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>i</i>, <i

<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>i</i> is in contact with more than 18
residues which are in contacts also with residue <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

with the simple filter described above are shown in Fig. 7. We note that for
percentages of errors less than 8% the reconstruction quality is independent
from the protein length, as in Fig. 5. This means that the filter skips large enough
faulty areas to avoid their negative influence on the whole reconstruction.
When errors are over 16% the reconstruction quality decreases at increasing protein
length. To avoid this behavior a better adjustment of filtering parameters (based
on number of expected contacts, or other types of filtering procedures) should
be considered. Nevertheless, in general the overall reconstruction

quality. To compare this result with the other tests described in this work, it
should be considered that 1000 errors are approximately 4% of the total number
of contact residue pairs and 4000 errors are approximately 16% of contact
residue pairs. </span></p>

Recovering a set of 3D coordinates having a specific contact map is
	 known as the realization problem of the unit-disk graph which
	 has been proved to be NP-hard (<a href="#references">Breu et al., 1998</a>). A series
	 of heuristic algorithms have been proposed to solve the
	 problem. Galaktinov and Marshall (<a href="#references">Galaktionov et al., 1994</a>)
	 reconstructed the structures of five small proteins by
	 adopting information relative to the residue coordination
	 numbers. Vendruscolo et al. (<a href="#references">Vendruscolo et al., 1997</a>)
	 described a method based on simulated annealing with the
	 contact map as a target potential.<br /><br />

Below we compare the average RMSD of 10 reconstructions done with
FT-COMAR to other results (<a
href="index.html#references">Galaktionov et al., 1994</a>).
For the sake of comparison
reconstructions are done from native contact maps without the introduction of errors. Results
of this table are computed using as contact
map threshold 13 &Aring; (thresholds of 9 or 12 &Aring;s yield
similar results).
