<p>ALCHEMY is a method for automated calling of diploid genotypes
  from raw intensity data produced by various high-throughput
  multiplexed SNP genotyping methods. ALCHEMY has been developed for
  and tested on Affymetrix GeneChip Arrays, Illumina GoldenGate, and
  Illumina Infinium based assays. Primary motivations for ALCHEMY's
  development was the lack of available genotype calling methods
  which can perform well in the absence of heterozygous samples (due
  to panels of inbred lines being genotyped) or provide accurate
  calls with small sample batches. ALCHEMY differs from other
  genotype calling methods in that genotype inference is based on a
  parametric Bayesian model of the raw intensity data rather than a
  generalized clustering approach and the model incorporates
  population genetic principles such as Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium,
  adjusted for inbreeding levels, and can simultaneously estimate
  individual sample inbreeding coefficients and use them to improve
  statistical inference of diploid genotypes at individual SNPs. The
  main documentation for ALCHEMY is maintained on the
  sourceforge-hosted MediaWiki system, use the links on the right for
  more information on ALCHEMY and its features and limitations.</p>

<p>ALCHEMY was initially developed by Dr. Mark Wright at <a href=http://www.cornell.edu>Cornell University</a> in
  the laboratories of
  <a href=http://ricelab.plbr.cornell.edu/>Dr. Susan McCouch</a> and
  <a href=http://bustamantelab.cb.bscb.cornell.edu/>
  Dr. Carlos Bustamante</a> as part of the
  <a href=http://www.ricehapmap.org/index.aspx>NSF-funded
    Transgressive Variation in Rice Project</a> (NSF #0606461) and is
  the recommended genotype calling software for SNP genotyping
  products developed by the project. For more information on genetic
  diversity in rice and on-going projects to discovery variation and
  genotype large collections of rice germplasm, see the
  <a href=http://www.ricediversity.org/> Rice Diversity Project</a></p>

<p>ALCHEMY is GPL free software hosted by <a target="_blank"
href="http://sourceforget.net">SourceForge.net</a>. Presently there
  are no official release files, but you can obtain ALCHEMY source
  directly from subversion with:
</p>
<p><textarea name="code" class="c:nocontrols:nogutter" cols="60" rows="2">
svn co https://alchemy.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alchemy/</textarea>
</p>

<p>ALCHEMY is written in C and developed on the GNU/Linux platform. It
  should compile on any current GNU/Linux distribution with
  development version of the
  <a href=http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>gsl</a> library installed. It may
  also compile and run on Mac OS X if gsl is installed.</p>

<h3>Citing ALCHEMY</h3>
<p>A peer-reviewed publication is in review after revision as of July
  2010. When the paper is in press, the citation will be given here.
