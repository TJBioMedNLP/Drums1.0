					<p>Fascinating story from <a href="http://mblogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2011/02/11/information-overload-quantified-humanity-can-store-295-exabytes-of-data/?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+80beats+%2880beats%29">Discover Magazine</a><br />
<blockquote>As of 2007, humans had the capacity to store 295 exabytes. An exabyte is 1018 bytes. If you think of the gigabytes (a billion bytes) in which your hard drive space might be measured, an exabyte is a billion of those gigabytes. Another size comparison: Astronomers, by necessity, are designing new information processing techniques to help them grapple with the coming age of “petascale” astronomy, because they’re starting to get more information than they can handle. “Exa” is the prefix after “peta”; it’s a thousand times more.</p></blockquote>

					<p><a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">This</a> article from <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org">PLOS Medicine</a> is a must-read for any biological scientist and a nice follow-up to my post from yesterday.  The title (which I&#8217;ve used as the title of this post) says it all, but the abstract says it better<br />
<blockquote>There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read the whole thing for a fascinating read that doesn&#8217;t require a Ph.D. to follow.</p>
<p>What I find truly fascinating is that there&#8217;s no specific scope restriction to &#8220;biological&#8221; or &#8220;medical&#8221; research <i>per se</i>.  Bad science happens in the physical sciences too, and for the same reasons: Human bias.  As long as the data pass through human eyes and human minds with human biases, they can be filtered or disposed of as &#8220;bad data&#8221; instead of refutations of prevailing dogmas or novel discoveries.  </p>
<p>A favorite <i>Asimovism</i> of mine is &#8220;The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not “Eureka” but “That&#8217;s funny&#8230;”&#8221;  But if you immediately reject &#8220;That&#8217;s funny&#8221; because of your prejudices, where is the science?

					<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/13/101213fa_fact_lehrer?currentPage=all">This</a> article from the New Yorker is quite possibly the best science article I&#8217;ve ever read. A snippet:<br />
<blockquote>But now all sorts of well-established, multiply confirmed findings have started to look increasingly uncertain. It’s as if our facts were losing their truth: claims that have been enshrined in textbooks are suddenly unprovable. This phenomenon doesn’t yet have an official name, but it’s occurring across a wide range of fields, from psychology to ecology. In the field of medicine, the phenomenon seems extremely widespread, affecting not only antipsychotics but also therapies ranging from cardiac stents to Vitamin E and antidepressants: Davis has a forthcoming analysis demonstrating that the efficacy of antidepressants has gone down as much as threefold in recent decades.</p>
<p>For many scientists, the effect is especially troubling because of what it exposes about the scientific process. If replication is what separates the rigor of science from the squishiness of pseudoscience, where do we put all these rigorously validated findings that can no longer be proved? Which results should we believe? Francis Bacon, the early-modern philosopher and pioneer of the scientific method, once declared that experiments were essential, because they allowed us to “put nature to the question.” But it appears that nature often gives us different answers.</p></blockquote>

					<p><a href="http://flowingdata.com/2010/12/29/old-map-shows-slavery-in-the-united-states/">This</a> post at <a href="http://flowingdata.com/">flowingdata.com</a> features a graphical representation of the slave populations of the American South that is exceptionally powerful.<br />
<a href="http://laurenzi.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/FULLFRAMEmap.jpg"><img src="http://laurenzi.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/FULLFRAMEmap-300x246.jpg" alt="" title="Visualizing Slavery" width="300" height="246" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-142" /></a><br />
The post refers to <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/visualizing-slavery/">this</a>post at the NY Times, which features a gorgeous PDF of the image.</p>
<p>One of the things that strikes me about this figure is it&#8217;s similarity to the map of Napoleon&#8217;s march on Russia by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard">Joseph Minard</a>, made famous by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_R._Tufte">Ed Tufte</a>&#8216;s books on effective visual communication.<br />
<a href="http://laurenzi.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Minard.jpg"><img src="http://laurenzi.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Minard-300x143.jpg" alt="" title="Minard" width="300" height="143" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-143" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the person who titled the Times piece had the same idea: It&#8217;s called &#8220;Visualizing Slavery&#8221; &#8211; a clear play on the titles of Tufte&#8217;s books.  In any event, Minard&#8217;s figure was in fact made later than the slavery map. Both were propaganda pieces &#8211; Minard&#8217;s is an anti-war piece that doesn&#8217;t even feature Napoleon&#8217;s name. </p>
<p>Was there a &#8220;Renaissance&#8221; of graphical design in the 1860s?  If so, it would seem that the economic driver of graphical design innovation is propaganda!</p>

<blockquote><p>God is always faithful to his<br />
promises, but he often surprises us in the way he fulfils them. The<br />
child that was born in Bethlehem did indeed bring liberation, but<br />
not only for the people of that time and place – he was to be the<br />
Saviour of all people <i>throughout the world and throughout<br />
history</i>. And it was not a political liberation that he<br />
brought, achieved through military means: rather, Christ destroyed<br />
death for ever and restored life by means of his shameful death on<br />
the Cross.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Whining PhD students are nothing new, but there seem to be genuine problems with the system that produces research doctorates (the practical “professional doctorates” in fields such as law, business and medicine have a more obvious value). <b>There is an oversupply of PhDs.</b> Although a doctorate is designed as training for a job in academia, the number of PhD positions is unrelated to the number of job openings. Meanwhile, business leaders complain about shortages of high-level skills, suggesting PhDs are not teaching the right things. <b>The fiercest critics compare research doctorates to Ponzi or pyramid schemes.</b></p></blockquote>

					<p>As you ponder why college is costing many people over $50k per year, you may with to add <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/innovations/the-great-college-degree-scam/28067">this</a> to your reading. Key quote:<br />
<blockquote>approximately 60 percent of the increase in the number of college graduates from 1992 to 2008 worked in jobs that the BLS considers relatively low skilled—occupations where many participants have only high school diplomas and often even less. Only a minority of the increment in our nation’s stock of college graduates is filling jobs historically considered as requiring a bachelor’s degree or more.</p></blockquote>
<p>(h/t <a href="http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/">Instapundit</a></p>
<p>Today, the only reason why college graduates have higher &#8220;on average&#8221; salaries than non grads is because engineers, scientists, doctors, accountants, actuaries, etc. are counted in that average. Remove those specialties and you&#8217;ll find that college is otherwise typically a huge waste of money.</p>
<p>For an estimate of how much your monthly loan payments will be, click <a href="http://www.finaid.org/calculators/loanpayments.phtml">here</a>. Given $200k of debt, (4 years in most private schools) you&#8217;ll have payments of about $2,300 per month which start the month following graduation. Unless you make $60,000 or more per year (which will net you about $3,300 per month), you can&#8217;t afford it. Even at that salary, could you make rent, groceries, utilities etc. with $1,000?</p>
<p>Now ask yourself this question: <i>Will I make this much when I graduate?</i></p>
