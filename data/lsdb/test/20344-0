<b>News:</b> A paper on ODES has been accepted, <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/21/2788.abstract"><i>Bioinformatics</i></a>, Vol. 26, No. 21. (1 November 2010), pp. 2788-2789; doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btq514

<b>ODES</b> is a pthreads parallelized exact algorithm to enumerate all maximal 
sub-graphs of a graph that exceed a specified cutoff density of at least 1/2, even 
if they overlap. Based on a theorem proved in our paper, the brute-force search 
space of a non-clique graph <b>G</b> is confined to the actual dense sub-graphs 
of <b>G</b>.
<br>
<br>
Features yet to implement:<br><br>
<li>run algorithm within a series of density bins that span the interval 0.5 to 1.0</li>
<li>replace binary search with a fast hash function</li>
<li>output some indication of overlaps</li>
<br>
Due to its high complexity, <b>ODES</b> does not scale well to large dense 
sub-graphs. This can be ameliorated, however, by using <b>ODES</b> in conjunction 
with a heuristic method. If heuristically determined edges from large dense 
sub-graphs <b>H</b> are excluded from the initial single-edge sub-graph list for 
<b>ODES</b>, but retained in the subsequent search space, <b>ODES</b> will find 
all other overlapping dense sub-graphs outside of <b>H</b>, along with those 
dense sub-graphs that overlap <b>H</b> containing at least one edge <b>E</b> 
outside of <b>H</b> that can be the last one chosen according to our theorem. 
Dense sub-graphs overlapping <b>H</b> that have no such edge <b>E</b> outside 
of <b>H</b> will not be found. See the README file for details to turn this 
feature on.
