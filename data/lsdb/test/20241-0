<p>
<b>Motivation:</b> Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is an
indispensable technology for identification of proteins from complex
mixtures. Proteins are digested to peptides that are then identified
by their fragmentation patterns in the mass spectrometer. Thus, at its
core, MS/MS protein identification relies on the relative
predictability of peptide fragmentation. Unfortunately, peptide
fragmentation is complex and not fully understood, and what is
understood is not always exploited by peptide identification
algorithms.</p>

<p>
<b>Results:</b> We use a hybrid dynamic Bayesian network (DBN)/support
vector machine (SVM) approach to address these two problems. We train
a set of DBNs on high-confidence peptide-spectrum matches. These DBNs,
known collectively as Riptide, comprise a probabilistic model of
peptide fragmentation chemistry. Examination of the distributions
learned by Riptide allows identification of new trends, such as
prevalent a-ion fragmentation at peptide cleavage sites C-term to
hydrophobic residues. In addition, Riptide can be used to produce
likelihood scores that indicate whether a given peptide-spectrum match
is correct. A vector of such scores is evaluated by an SVM, which
produces a final score to be used in peptide identification. Using
Riptide in this way yields improved discrimination when compared to
other state-of-the-art MS/MS identification algorithms, increasing the
number of positive identifications by as much as 12% at a 1% false
discovery rate.</p>
