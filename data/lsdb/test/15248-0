<h1>Summary Tree Explorer</h1>

<p>
The Summary Tree Explorer (STE) is an open-source Java application for interactively exploring sets of phylogenetic trees using two coupled representations: a node-and-link diagram of a summary tree and a textual list of common clades, as shown in the figure below. Selection, pruning, filtering, or re-rooting in one representation is immediately reflected in the other. This <a href="http://cityscape.inf.cs.cmu.edu/phylogeny/Derthick.pdf">Application Note</a> provides more detail.

STE accepts input files in NEXUS or Newick format, including files generated by MrBayes, PHYLIP, BAMBE, BADGER, and PAUP. Here is a more <a href="Parser.html">formal input file specification</a>.
STE does not accept weights on trees, so you must include the same tree multiple times to get that effect.

<p>
How to run the Summary Tree Explorer on your computer:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Make sure you have Java 1.4 or later installed.  You can download the latest JRE <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/">here</a>.

<li>
Download the following file to a local directory
<ul>
<li>
<a href="phylogeny.jar">http://cityscape.inf.cs.cmu.edu/phylogeny/phylogeny.jar</a>
<li>
Optionally download example input files from <a href="Data">http://cityscape.inf.cs.cmu.edu/phylogeny/Data/</a>
</ul>

<li>
Run the program:

<ol>
<li>
Open phylogeny.jar


<li>
A "Load Forest" dialog box will open up, and you select the tree file you want to analyze.  After that, you can switch to another file in the same directory using a menu.
</ol>


or



<ol>
<li>
From a command line or batch file, something like this<p>
<code>java -Xmx256M -jar phylogeny.jar "C:\myTrees.nex" 100 1000</code>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Change the "256" to give Java more or less than 256MB of memory.
</li><li>If you provide your filename as an argument, it won't display the dialog box. </li><li>The last two optional arguments specify a "stride" and a "burn in." Only stride'th trees are read in, for example if stride is 3, it reads the zeroth, third, sixth, etc. The first burn-in'th trees are skipped.  Burn-in 10 and stride 3 will read trees 12, 15, 18, etc. Using the gui, there are boxes to specify stride and burn-in to the right of the file choices.  The default values are 1 and 0, which will read every tree.
