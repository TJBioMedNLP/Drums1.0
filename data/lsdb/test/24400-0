        <b>Abstract:</b> 
        The expression of genes during the cell division process has now been
        studied in a many different species.  An important goal of these
        studies is to identify the set of cycling genes. To date, this was
        done independently for each of the species studied.  Due to noise and
        other data analysis problems, accurately deriving a set of cycling
        genes from expression data is a hard problem. This is especially true
        for some of the multicellular organisms, including humans.
        <p/>
        Here we present the first algorithm that combines microarray
        expression data from multiple species for identifying cycling
        genes. Our algorithm represents genes from multiple species as nodes
        in a graph.  Edges between genes represent sequence similarity.
        Starting with the measured expression values for each species we use
        Belief Propagation to determine a posterior score for genes. This
        posterior is used to determine a new set of cycling genes for each
        species.
        <p/>
        We applied our algorithm to improve the identification of the set of
        cell cycle genes in budding yeast and humans.  As we show, by
        incorporating sequence similarity information we were able to obtain a
        more accurate set of genes compared to methods that rely on expression
        data alone.  Our method was especially successful for the human
        dataset indicating that it can use a high quality dataset from one
        species to overcome noise problems in another.
