                        <p>By Ruth Malone, Editor</p>
<p>When the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control was being negotiated  several years back, I was among many others around the world who were  impressed with the unanimity and power exerted by the African countries’  delegates. It is not an exaggeration to say that it is in many respects  because of strong advocacy from African countries that we have as  strong a global treaty to work with. For that reason, I was excited to  meet with African tobacco control advocates, researchers and  policymakers from 14 African countries whom I met in Johannesburg, South  Africa recently for a Tobacco Control journal-sponsored publishing  workshop (see photo). These are individuals who are doing incredible  work, often with very limited resources and often at some personal risk  due to government corruption and/or industry influence. Editorial board  member Stella Aguinaga Bialous and I travelled to Johannesburg to hear  about the work underway across the continent. We brainstormed with the  group about their ideas for articles and discussed the requirements for  submitting papers, the mentorship program for promising papers offered  by the journal under Bloomberg sponsorship, and the global interest in  the activities taking place on the African continent. We are looking  forward to publishing more great research and advocacy work from African  countries!</p>

                        <p>By Stephen Hamill<br />
Online Communications Manager<br />
World Lung Foundation</p>
<p>Leveraging a unique law that allows for free prime-time advertising for anti-tobacco ads, Turkey has adapted and launched the hard-hitting &#8220;Sponge&#8221; campaign, originally produced by the Cancer Institute New South Wales in Australia. The campaign, on both radio and television, is the first to feature Turkey&#8217;s new quit-smoking hotline.</p>
<p>From all accounts, the campaign has had a terrific impact, with the quit line receiving more than 200,000 calls the first month and tying up all 16 operators at all hours. The ad has also entered public consciousness, appearing in chat rooms, billboards and newspapers. One prominent columnist wrote &#8220;Have you seen the Ministry of Health&#8217;s new tv spot? It is one of the strongest ads<br />
I have ever seen, unlike previous campaigns . . . Thank you to the Ministry of health &#8211; when I see this ad I tremble, and ask myself &#8216;How can people smoke?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>In retrospect, the impact is not that surprising: One of the world&#8217;s best tobacco control ads is being aired to the world&#8217;s 10th largest male smoking population, and this is the first time a quitting resource has been offered. A busy quitline is a good problem to have; it indicates that smokers are being motivated to quit in droves. It&#8217;s worth remembering that, if the Turkish experience mirrors international evidence, every hotline call represents several other smokers who have decided to quit on their own. Even in countries with excellent, and often free, quit resources, more than 80% of smokers quit cold turkey (pun intended!) on their own.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Sponge&#8221; campaign is an exciting step for Turkey, who has gradually implemented more and more graphic and effective campaigns over the last three years. Buoyed by a strong anti-tobacco advocate Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the country has begun implementing policy measures in every MPOWER area and become a world leader in tobacco control. Where they were once known for careless habits around smoking and health, as one recent newspaper said, &#8220;The phrase &#8216;Smoke Like a Turk&#8217; seems destined for the rubbish bin of history.&#8221;</p>

                        <p>James Watson (also known as jwatso or Junican) won the TC website poll for best ideas for new ways to talk about tobacco control with 77% of the vote. Some of Mr. Watson’s colleagues on several pro-tobacco blogs may have helped push his good idea over the top, but this provides even more convincing evidence that it is indeed a good idea. It’s one about which we recently published an analysis in the journal (Callard, Follow the Money, Tob Control 2010;19:285-290).</p>
<p>Mr. Watson’s proposed idea was to emphasise the following:</p>
<p>1. If people purchase cigarettes from foreign multinationals, THE PROFITS are leaving the country.<br />
2. However, the COSTS, in terms of health consequences remain [in] the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Watson also submitted a range of other comments, including one in which the first letter of each paragraph spelled out the word ‘propaganda.’ We noticed this, although we did not find it quite as clever as Mr. Watson apparently did, according to an email to us and other blog posts elsewhere, but as it is our policy with the blog to encourage discussion, we do not reject comments simply because the editors do not agree with them.</p>
<p>In any case, Mr. Watson has won the poll and we sincerely hope that he will use his free subscription to the journal to educate himself further about how the tobacco industry has funded and used ‘smoker’s rights’ groups and others to advance its interests while misleading smokers and undermining even the most reasonable public health protections.</p>

                        <p>Success in tobacco control will not happen without public health champions speaking freely and honestly to the public. As professor Gérard Dubois explains below, there is real danger these voices are being silenced.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
Gérard Dubois MD MPH<br />
Public Health. University hospital. 80000 Amiens. France<a href="http://blogs.bmj.com/tc/files/2010/11/shhh.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-100" title="shhh" src="http://blogs.bmj.com/tc/files/2010/11/shhh.jpg" alt="" width="287" height="287" /></a></p>
<p>As is happening in the UK, France is beginning to experience an abuse of the libel laws. In 2009, through my role as professor of public health at Amiens University Hospital, I stated on French TV that cigarettes kill two smokers a year for every tobacconist. As a result, I am being sued by the French tobacconists’ union. The irony is that in June 2009 I received a “Knowledge for the World” award from the Johns Hopkins Alumni Association for making the very same claim. (1) I also chair the Alliance Prévention Alcool, a charity established in June 2010 to federate the organizations that oppose dangerous and inconsistent policies. Indeed, this is a serious challenge in France. For example, in June 2009, the Government issued new laws to “improve” the healthcare system but it also allowed for advertising of alcohol on the internet &#8211; the favoured media of young people. This nearly nullified ‘Evin’s law’ issued in 1991 to ban or limit alcohol advertising in traditional media and during sports events.(2)</p>
<p>Since 2006, Dr Alain Braillon had been a senior tenured consultant in my unit at Amiens, until his surprise sacking last December when his position, as head of the regional body for the assessment of professional practices, was abolished by a few members voting through an unscheduled agenda item at the hospital board meeting. Known as a “high profile expert on public health”(4) he had been in charge of several regional programmes, such as hepatitis B prevention, smoking cessation in pregnancy and suicide prevention, that were all brutally terminated by the director of the Regional Health Administration. Braillon has also taken a high profile stand on many public health issues, not only the law which allowed the advertising of alcohol on the internet, but also the controversial practice of population screening of prostate cancer.(3) The chairman of the French Public Health society said “This is the first case of the sacking of a public health expert that I have heard of.”(4).</p>
<p>France’s National Management Centre of the Ministry of Health unfairly investigated Braillon’s case to confirm the sacking. There were several breaches of the Freedom of Information Act and no evidence was heard from either myself or Braillon. Nevertheless the majority of the members of its advisory body, the National Statutory Committee, advised against the sacking. However, the National Management Centre overturned this advice. This rollercoaster ride of overturning decisions is highly unusual – the coincidence is exceptional!</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Health and Sport Minister Roselyne Bachelot said she was shocked when British American Tobacco announced it was dropping the price of a pack of 20 cigarettes in France from €5.50 to €5.30 for two of its brands, Rothmans and Lucky Strike. Her calls for a tax increase in order to prevent young people from smoking were ignored.  The Elysée (The French White House) consistently supports the tobacco, alcohol and online gambling industries but ignores the best evidence to reduce the health burden on the French people.</p>

                        <p>Ruth Malone challenged Tobacco Control readers and contributors to devise &#8220;ideas for new language weapons in the word wars &#8220;. Given how many of you responded, this is something people are definitely thinking about. Using the right language is a crucial strategy in tobacco control. Sometimes the right language happens by a happy accident, other times it is a result of a carefully crafted media sound bite, and sometimes we just can’t seem to get the language right. So what do you think – does this shortlist of entries make the cut or do you have a better idea?</p>
<p><a href="http://poll.fm/2dm21" target="_self">Vote in our poll</a> – the winner gets a free subscription to their favourite journal, Tobacco Control. And, leave your feedback below if you have other ideas or suggestions about the language we use to combat tobacco use.</p>
<h2><a href="http://poll.fm/2dm21"><img class="size-full wp-image-82 alignleft" title="Click here to vote in the online poll..." src="http://blogs.bmj.com/tc/files/2010/10/tcpoll.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="430" /></a><strong>Detailed shortlist of entries</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Lezak Shallat: </strong>In my experience, there is a real clash of discourses between the language we use in tobacco control and the language we should be using to reach out to potential (and much needed) allies in the women’s movement. This raises a linguistic and ideological barrier that impedes greater collaboration. A case in point is the concept of tobacco “control”. For the TC movement, the word “control” encompasses a strategy to focus on a product and not its users (smokers) by setting limits that protect the rights of non-users. Within the TC movement, there is little talk of “anti-tobacco” measures or policies. This abbreviated terminology is reserved for headlines and journalists. Among feminists, however, the word “control” raises hives. It is located at the opposite end of the spectrum from autonomy over one’s body and the right to decide for oneself about work, education, reproductive life and more. This idea is central to feminism, and has been successfully exploited by the tobacco industry as a concept to sell cigarettes. The discourses clash. Control vs. protection; freedom to chose vs. informed choice; promoting vs. exploiting aspirations of “autonomy.” These words carry ideological subtexts that hinder greater dialogue with the feminists about how to address smoking as a women’s health issue.</p>
<p><strong>Zach:</strong> Telling people who are trying to quit smoking to &#8220;think about it as if you are breaking up with your best friend who has been deceiving you for X amount of years.&#8221; This helps them understand the emotional struggle they will face with quitting. Framing the issue properly helps break down the mechanics of quitting or fighting the industry into its basic form, which makes it easier to generalize to other things in life, which helps us understand what we are up against.</p>
<p><strong>Stewart Brock:</strong> I was reading a report just yesterday on BAT&#8217;s financial results and annual report, with lots of talk about growing markets in developing countries etc. I thought it would be good to produce an alternative article, changing the focus from financial issues to disease ones, while maintaining the style of a city story. So instead of the article reading: &#8220;The company reported that Africa and Asia delivered the best performance, with strong volume growth in Pakistan, Bangladesh, South Korea, Nigeria and the Gulf. &#8221; it might read: &#8220;Strong volume growth in Pakistan, Bangladesh, South Korea, Nigeria and the Gulf should lead to increased levels of addiction with excellent prospects for lung cancer growth in future decades.&#8221;<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrea Portenier:</strong> First, there is no such thing as a &#8220;smoker&#8221;. No one is born with a pack of Marlboros in their hands. Smoking is not innate. Breathing is. Using the word &#8220;smoker&#8221; creates the impression of an innate characteristic which is to be accorded certain rights. If we want to get rid of the impression that smoking is a right, it only makes sense, doesn&#8217;t it, to use language that dissolves the impression that it is. The inculcation through language that smoking is a state of being, rather than an activity, also can make it harder for someone to free themselves of their addiction. It is after all harder to quit being something than doing something. If every journal would make an editorial decision to not print this word, other than as a quote, we would go a long way towards reducing tobacco use.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Jwatso:</strong> We must understand that the multinational Tobacco companies are not really interested in the UK and Europe any more. Their markets are in India, Pakistan and China, etc. The new words need to be projected to the rulers of these nations, possibly via the UN.<br />
1. If people purchase cigarettes from foreign multinationals, THE PROFITS are leaving the country.<br />
2. However, the COSTS, in terms of health consequences remain the country.</p>
<p><strong>Terence A. Gerace, Ed.M., M.A., Ph.D.</strong>: The terms Big Tobacco, tobacco industry, and major tobacco companies should be eliminated in favor of &#8220;toxic-tobacco companies&#8221; or &#8220;toxic-tobacco industry&#8221;. None of the former terms provides the true negative denotation that &#8220;toxic-tobacco companies&#8221; and &#8220;toxic-tobacco industry&#8221; do. Placing “Big” in front of Tobacco blunts tobacco&#8217;s negative associations. “Big” has a positive connotation as evidenced by McDonalds Corporation&#8217;s using “Big” in front of &#8220;Mac&#8221; and Frito-Lay placing “Big” before &#8220;Grab&#8221; to designate its large bag of snacks for individuals.</p>

                        <p>In the August 2010 issue of Tobacco Control, Cynthia Callard wrote an <a href="http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/19/4/285.full" target="_blank">enlightening article</a> on just how uneven the playing field is in tobacco control. She compared the 2008 total revenues of<a href="http://blogs.bmj.com/tc/files/2010/09/Money-Cigarette3.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-67" title="Money Cigarette" src="http://blogs.bmj.com/tc/files/2010/09/Money-Cigarette3.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="184" /></a> the five major tobacco companies that control 90% of the global market as compared to the total amount spent on global tobacco control. The results show just how much the deck is stacked against effective tobacco control, especially in low and middle income countries. The revenues of these five companies exceeded $300 billion ($160 billion of that is provided to governments as tax) and the corporate earnings of the four publicly traded companies were over $25 billion, of which $14 billion was retained after corporate income taxes were paid. In comparison, funding for global tobacco control was a paltry $240 million. That would be less than 2% of the retained earnings of the four public companies alone.<br />
Considering the profitability of the devastating global tobacco death toll – to say this seems unjust is a gross understatement. What is even more nauseating, is that these profits are coming from some of the poorest people in the poorest nations in the world and ending up in the pockets of wealthy stockholders in the richest countries.</p>
<p>In her article, Callard proposes innovative solutions to divert some of this money to tobacco control</p>
<ul>
<li>:use of transaction taxes on the flow of profits from countries where multinational tobacco companies sell cigarettes to countries where theydistribute the profits or other fiscal instruments</li>
<li>health promotion surtax on tobacco manufacturers&#8217; earnings or ringfenced taxes on consumption of tobacco products</li>
<li>develop guidelines under the auspices of the FCTC to mandate the use of profit taxes to raise funds for national and international tobacco control efforts</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>What do you think? How can we increase funding for global tobacco control? Should we push for a “polluter pays” system? What other innovative models could be adopted?</strong></em></p>

<p>Some of the most impressive work in the global tobacco wars is never noticed<a href="http://blogs.bmj.com/tc/files/2010/07/death.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-39" title="death" src="http://blogs.bmj.com/tc/files/2010/07/death.jpg" alt="" width="216" height="326" /></a> within the battlefields of city councils, legislatures, regulatory agencies or courtrooms. Instead, it is carried out much more subtly, on the front lines of everyday word wars. Words not only represent and describe, they also reflect and constitute our very understanding of what the issues are: they ‘make reality’. Smoking denormalisation and tobacco industry delegitimisation, so critical to 21st century tobacco control efforts, did not just naturally extend from an earlier focus on telling individuals not to smoke and helping individuals quit one by one. Rather, a few thought leaders began to put into language fundamentally new ways of talking about tobacco as a societal problem. For example, the brilliant ‘vector’ analytic of LeGresley(1) changed forever the way public health views the tobacco industry.</p>
<p>Contemporary philosopher Charles Taylor identified three important aspects of language(2): first, in language we formulate things, bringing to full awareness what we may have previously understood only implicitly. Taylor shows how, when we can&#8217;t articulate something, we are also unable to decide how to focus on it, how different aspects of it may be related, how it figures amidst other things. When we finally break through and find the words for it, this new language allows us to better understand its boundaries and grapple with it in new ways. Thus, when LeGresley and others pointed out in fresh language the parallels between tobacco companies and the mosquitoes that transmit malaria, they brought to the forefront of public attention the need to address the supply side of the tobacco disease epidemic.</p>
<p>Second, language puts things into a public space where we can share understandings—but beyond that, Taylor says, it actually creates that public space or shared vantage point. This is not merely a matter of communicating ‘information’; it also creates an ‘us’. Taylor gives an example of two people riding in a hot train car. One turns to the other and says, ‘Whew, it&#8217;s hot’. Each person already knows this; the language is not conveying anything new. What it is doing is putting into words their shared experience, and in so doing, creating a new shared space. The laughing recognition of a then-common experience that followed comedian George Carlin&#8217;s quip that ‘a smoking section in a restaurant is like a peeing section in a swimming pool’ created a new space quickly shared by advocates in many places, who used it effectively to argue for 100% smokefree policies.</p>
<p>Finally, Taylor points out that language grounds our moral sense as human beings, enables us to draw distinctions about meaning based on understandings about what we value most. Language is ‘constitutive’: it shapes common understandings about our social relationships with one another, our practices, our aspirations and goals. Helping people understand that lung cancer was not always so common a disease, that we face an industrially produced epidemic, calls attention to the moral problem of corporations and individuals promoting and profiting from deadly products.</p>
<p>In too many places even today, tobacco use is still taken for granted and if problematised at all, is understood primarily as an individual ‘bad habit’ rather than an ongoing failure by governments to provide adequate public health-based constraints on the disease-promoting practices of powerful corporate interests.(3–5) This is why it is important for all of us to attend to how our language serves or undermines tobacco companies&#8217; preferred framing of ‘smoking and health’ issues, of cigarettes as a ‘risky product’ and of ‘responsibility’ as comprised primarily of providing ‘information’ in a decontextualised way.(6)</p>
<p>Instead, we should insist on talking about ‘smoking and disease’, ‘deadly products’ and corporate responsibility as acting in a way that is consistent with being fully accountable for the effects of the products one sells when they are used as intended. We should also discontinue discussion of ‘giving up’ smoking, a construction that makes becoming free of tobacco addiction a loss rather than a gain; we should stop calling our new pack labels ‘graphic health warnings’ and instead call them ‘graphic disease warnings’. We also ought to stop calling tobacco addiction a ‘habit’, as though it were comparable to the habits of brushing one&#8217;s teeth, eating cereal each morning for breakfast, or staying up late at night reading in bed.</p>
<p>As Chapman argues, ‘epidemiologists&#8217; currency in debate is probabilistic data on risk, but this is not how communities define problems, nor why they can become outraged about low-risk issues, remain indifferent to some high-risk exposures or support some policy responses and not others.’(7) Instead, new problems come to be defined through new definitions and arguments advanced by advocates using fresh language—or using old language in new ways. Tobacco Control&#8217;s readers are always seeking innovation in how we talk about what we do and the tobacco industry is continually adapting itself to new circumstances, while reframing doing the same old thing as ‘responsible’.</p>

<p>Indonesia is one of the world’s most difficult places to do tobacco control, with a strong tobacco industry presence and a lot of political resistance from tobacco growers and their allies. Huge tobacco billboards are everywhere in the city of Jakarta. Yet, as we discovered on a recent visit, tobacco control advocates and researchers there are doing great work of global importance.</p>
<p>Commissioning editor for Low and Middle Income Countries Simon Chapman  and I conducted a workshop in Jakarta aimed at  encouraging more publications from low and middle income countries and  enthusiasm ran high. Hosted by the Faculty of Public Health at  University of Jakarta and coordinated by Mary Assunta, Director,  International Tobacco Control Project, Cancer Council Australia, the  workshop focused on bringing great ideas to fruition as journal  articles, so that lessons learned in Indonesia can help other countries  faced with similar political challenges.</p>

<p>Ruth Malone and Becky Freeman</p>
<p>Tobacco Control has now joined the BMJ Group Blogs – welcome to our inaugural post!  Ok, ok, so maybe we’re a tad late to the party – but we’re here now and we promise to make it worth the wait.</p>
<p>Our master plan for this blog is that it will be topical, engaging, and most important of all include participation from TC readers, authors, reviewers, and editors. The tone and character will be collegial, but we warmly welcome the cheeky and irreverent. In keeping with the spirit of blogging, the style will be conversational and entries short for easy and enjoyable reading.</p>
<p>So to kick things off in that vein&#8230;</p>
<p>Seems there is no limit to the creativity of tobacco industry when it comes to inventing new ways to recruit addicts.</p>
<p>BAT Korea is this week launching the <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2010/07/123_69363.html">KENT Convertible</a> – a cigarette which contains a liquid capsule in the filter that can be clicked to release a burst of flavour.<br />
According to BAT Korea&#8217;s Marketing Executive Director Guy Meldrum,</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“The cutting-edge taste transmission technology of KENT Convertibles now allows consumers to interact with their cigarettes to choose whenever they want to experience a new smoking sensation.&#8221; </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe these flavour capsules could be used to our advantage though – if they were only permitted if they actually made the smoke taste of the real ingredients in cigarettes? Can’t imagine a formaldehyde flavoured “KENT Convertible” would be a big seller.</p>
<p>Got an idea for a topic for the blog, or perhaps you’d like to submit a blog posting? <a href="mailto:becky.freeman@sydney.edu.au">Email</a> Becky Freeman (TC’s Asst Editor of New Media) to discuss possibilities.</p>
