      <p><font size="2">The objective of this course is to give the student an
      introduction to the science of human physiology. Emphasis will be placed
      on general underlying principles and mechanisms. It is not the idea to
      cover all aspects of human physiology, this would necessarily have to be
      very superficial because of the constraints of time. The idea is that the
      student by the end of the course, can pick up any textbook of physiology
      and understand whatever later becomes of interest.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">This course does not only focus on content. Equally
      important is the process by which the learning has been achieved. The idea
      is that in your working life you will face numerous problems to be solved
      and almost always this will be some kind of group effort. It is therefore
      crucial to become efficient in identifying learning issues, finding
      information, realizing the existence of and using a wide variety of
      resources, integrating, sharing and presenting information.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">It is essential that various resource materials be used.
      This will be further discussed in class. Some texts will be available on
      reserve in the health sciences library.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The course will also discuss drugs related to
      physiological problems. This is however not a pharmacology course. Drugs
      are used only as a vehicle to understand human physiology. By
      understanding how the body reacts to a drug and to a lesser extend what
      the drug does to the body, we will thoroughly understand many body
      functions.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Throughout this semester, everyone will work in a group
      of 6-10 students (dependent on enrolment numbers). The group work will
      start with the presentation of a problem. The idea is not to quickly
      &quot;solve&quot; the problem. The idea is to use the problem as a
      starting point and a focus point for learning. Starting with the problem,
      the group will define learning tasks keeping in mind the general
      objectives of the course.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Each group will meet every other week with the
      instructor and each group has one hour to present some of the data
      gathered, to discuss problems encountered and to evaluate progress. One
      person will be chosen at random to lead this discussion and present the
      general accomplishments of the group. He/she can ask the assistance of
      others during the presentation if needed. It is therefore very important
      that everyone is well aware of what other group members are doing. In
      between the meetings with the instructor, the group meets as often as they
      want.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Each person in the group will keep a log book (see
      elsewhere for specifics) and this book will be handed in every two weeks
      and will be returned two days later.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">What each individual student has to do:&nbsp;</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">be fully aware of course objectives</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">keep a log book</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">attend group meetings and actively participate</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">be prepared to lead discussion in each group meeting
          with instructor</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">be prepared to give the end unit presentation</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">write one essay with a topic outside of the group
          problem (has to be approved by myself)</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2">For general questions, you can email teaching assistant
      <b>Jing Li (lij58@mcmaster.ca)</b> ;
      Or if needed, myself (huizinga@mcmaster.ca).</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">In addition to the group work there is one individual
      essay to be written&nbsp;
      on a physiological topic outside of the problem you are working on.</font></p>
