<P> 
<B>
MUTAGEN have recently been re-implemented from scratch. So it now
contains more functionality and features. </B> If you have any
enquires regarding this new version please email: dbs [at]
dac.molbio.ku.dk. 
<A HREF='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15995215&query_hl=1'>The
original paper can be found here </A>.



<p>
MUTAGEN is a system for handling information for functional annotation of 
microbial genomes. The system has five main parts; 1) gene finding and 
collection of data for identification of function, 2) storage of sequence 
and collected data, 3) a webbased user interface for presentation of 
collected data and for manual annotations, 4) a database system for storing 
and retrieving the annotations, and 5) a sequence comparison tool which can 
compare genomic neighbourhoods of genes from different organisms, to 
improve the quality of annotations.
MUTAGEN can be used simultaneously on several gapped genomes, each with 
different assembly versions, making it possible to start the annotation 
process before the sequencing and assembly is finished. In MUTAGEN, it is 
easy to navigate with the graphical sequence browsers and search 
facilities. The data for functional annotation of each entry is presented 
in a comprehensible way and new entries can easily be added through the 
user interface.

<p>

MUTAGEN is released as open source under GLP. The code available for
<a href="http://dac.molbio.ku.dk/bioinformatics/MUTAGEN/download.html">download here</A>, and we
currently have <a HREF='https://dac.molbio.ku.dk/dbs/Sulfolobus/'>a demo version</A> of the system running so you can test it.</a>

<h3>The data collection</h3>
<p>
The strength of automatic annotation is of course its speed while the 
problem is that organism specific knowledge is lost, and that the 
assignment of function is not debated in questionable cases. An alternative 
to automatic annotations is to go through all the genes manually, this is a 
time consuming task, but can be made much faster and more thorough by 
automatic collection and presentation of relevant data to the annotator.
The current setup in MUTAGEN relies on automatic data collection, but due 
to the nature of the system, it could easily be altered to display gene 
information derived from an automatic annotation system.
The information collected in MUTAGEN can be divided into 3 groups; gene 
finding, functional identification through homology and ab initio 
prediction of protein features.
The protein coding genes can be identified by a prokaryotic gene finder 
such as EasyGene [7] or the build-in ORF finder that finds all open reading 
frames. MUTAGEN uses tRNA-scan [8] and the Ribosomal Database Project [5]to 
identify tRNA and rRNA coding genes.
Similarity to known proteins are used to identify the putative functions of 
the genes. Similarities are found by BLASTing [1] against databases such as 
SWISS-PROT [4], COG [11], NCBI [3], and by creating custom databases. 
EUCLID [10] is used to assign a functional category based on keywords in 
matching SWISS-PROT entries. Functional categories from the COG system are 
linked to genes and stored in the database. Sequences are also searched 
against the Pfam [2] protein profile database, in order to locate 
relationships to protein families.
If no matching sequences are found, ab initio prediction methods are the 
only way to gain a potential functional assignment based on sequence. 
Therefore we have included the methods TMHMM [6] for predicting 
transmembrane segments in proteins, and signalP [9] for predicting signal 
peptides and membrane anchors.
