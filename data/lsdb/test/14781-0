			<h1> Welcome to CompuBioTicDB, a database of biological components for synthetic biology </h1>
			<p> Introduction </p>
			<hr />
			
			<p>
			CompuBioTicDB database stores biological molecules, such as proteins and metabolites, as well as devices such as sensors, switches or timekeepers, which use the molecules as basic parts.
			Following the analogy with electronic components, we propose devices that are biological components for synthetic biology and that can be assembled in order to form a synthetic biological system. These devices are molecular elements which play pre-determined well-defined roles. An instance of device is the switch device: it is capable of switching on a synthetic biological system for example by initiating a reaction producing a compounded indispensable to the next reactions. Basically, those components are abstract, but their molecular implementations are made of proteins and small molecules from the database. Devices constitute a higher level in the abstraction hierarchy of components for synthetic biology regarding to the basic biological molecules.
			We classified these functional devices in six categories: compartmentalization devices, compartmental environment control devices, time management devices, shape management devices, energy provider devices, and biological signal management devices.
