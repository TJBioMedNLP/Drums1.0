<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Incorporating biological prior knowledge into predictive 
models is a challenging data integration problem in analyzing high-dimensional genomic 
data. We introduce a hypergraph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm called
<em>HyperPrior</em> to classify gene expression and arrayCGH data using biological 
knowledge as constraints on graph-based learning. <em>HyperPrior</em> is a robust 
two-step iterative method that alternatively finds the optimal labeling of the samples 
and the optimal weighting of the features, guided by constraints encoding prior 
knowledge. The prior knowledge for analyzing gene expression data is that cancer-related 
genes tend to interact with each other in a protein-protein interaction network. 
Similarly, the prior knowledge for analyzing arrayCGH data is that probes that are 
spatially nearby in their layout along the chromosomes tend to be involved in the 
same amplification or deletion event. Based on the prior knowledge, <em>HyperPrior</em> 
imposes a consistent weighting of the correlated genomic features in graph-based 
learning.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> We applied <em>HyperPrior</em> to test two arrayCGH 
datasets and two gene expression datasets for both cancer classification and biomarker 
identification. On all the datasets, <em>HyperPrior</em> achieved competitive classification 
performance, compared with SVMs and the other baselines utilizing the same prior 
knowledge. <em>HyperPrior</em> also identified several discriminative regions on 
chromosomes and discriminative subnetworks in the PPI, both of which contain cancer-related 
genomic elements. Our results suggest that <em>HyperPrior</em> is promising in utilizing 
biological prior knowledge to achieve better classification performance and more 
biologically interpretable findings in gene expression and arrayCGH data.</p>
