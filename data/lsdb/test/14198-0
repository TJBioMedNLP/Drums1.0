Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) is a method of large-scale gene expression 
analysis that has the potential to generate the full list of mRNAs present whithin a cell
population at a given time and their frequency. This method is based on the assumption that
short cDNA sequences (tags) are in most cases sufficient to identify transcripts. Thus 
the counting of the tags provides a numerical measurement of quantity of each transcript. 
An essential step in SAGE library analysis is the unambiguous assignment of each tag to the 
transcript from which it is derived, which is called tag-to-gene mapping.
</p>
<p align="justify">
We designed and implemented a tool called Identitag for tag-to-gene mapping. This tool
is based on a relational database which structure can be depicted as three interconnected
modules represented in <a HREF="Identitag_relational_schema.pdf">Identitag relational schema</a>. 
The first one stores virtual  tags extracted from transcript sequences belonging to the species
considered the second stores experimental tags observed in SAGE experiments, and the third
allows the  annotation of the transcript sequences used for virtual tag extraction. Identitag
therefore connects  an observed tag to a virtual tag and to the transcript sequence from which
it is derived, and then to its functional annotation when available. For a complete description
of Identitag tables see Identitag <a HREF="Identitag_data_dictionary.pdf">data dictionary</a>.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Databases made from different species can be <a HREF="Identitag_with_Orthology.pdf">connected</a>
according to orthology relationship thus allowing the comparison of SAGE libraries between species. We designed a 
<a HREF="Design_Orthology_relationship.pdf">method</a> to search for
putative orthologous sequences between two set of transcript sequences that can be redundant and 
not representing the entire transcriptome of the two species considered.
Identitag can thus be used for comparative transcriptomic analysis.

<h3>Use of Identitag for tag-to-gene mapping</h3>
<p align="justify">
This website provides Identitag sources that can be used to build an Identitag database 
for any species for which transcript sequences are available. These sources can be used on
SUN, Linux and MacOSX operating systems, with Bourne Shell and Perl interpreters and a MySQL
client (one also need a MySQL server, but it can be on another host). For more details, 
please read <a HREF="Identitag_documentation.pdf">Identitag documentation for tag-to-gene mapping</a>.
</p>
<h3>Use of Identitag for comparative transcriptomic analysis</h3>
<p align="justify">
Before doing comparative transcriptomic analysis, two Identitag databases for two different species
must be built (see previous section). Then this website provides sources allowing to connect
these two Identitag databases using orthology relationship : the scripts provided search for 
putative orthologous sequences between the two set of transcript sequences from these two different 
species. Then these putative orthologous relationships are loaded into Identitag database. In
addition to requirements specify in previous section, blastall, blastclust and formatdb executables
must be operational on your computer. For more details, please read
<a HREF="Orthology_documentation.pdf">Identitag documentation for comparative transcriptomic analysis</a>.
