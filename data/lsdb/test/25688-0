<h3 style="text-align: center" id="abstract">Abstract</h3><p>
Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by genome tiling
array hybridization (ChIP-chip) is a powerful approach to identify
transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in target genomes.
When multiple related ChIP-chip datasets are available,
analyzing them jointly allows one to borrow
information across datasets to improve peak detection. This is particularly useful
for analyzing noisy datasets.
<p>
We propose a hierarchical mixture model and develop an R package
<bf>JAMIE</br> (<u>J</u>oint <u>A</u>nalysis of <u>M</u>ultiple <u>I</u>P <u>E</u>xperiments) 
to perform the joint analysis.
The genome is assumed to consist of background and
potential binding regions (PBRs). PBRs
have context-dependent probabilities to become bona
fide binding sites in individual datasets.
This model captures the correlation
among datasets, which provides
basis for sharing information across experiments.
Real data tests illustrate the advantage of
JAMIE over a strategy that analyzes individual datasets separately.

<h3 id="background"><b>Background</b></h3><br>
ChIP-chip is a powerful approach to study protein-DNA interactions.
With rapid growth of ChIP-chip data in public repositories such as
Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett <i>et al.</i> 2009), 
it becomes more and more common 
that multiple datasets related to the same TF,
pathway or biological system are collected.
When multiple such datasets are available,
it is often desirable to analyze them jointly.
<p>
The motivation of this project can be illustrated in below Figure 1, 
which shows four related ChIP-chip experiments (GEO access numbers GSE11062
and GSE17682) performed by two different labs 
using Affymetrix Mouse Promoter 1.0R arrays. 
The first experiment has low signal-to-noise ratio due to 
technological and biological reasons. A careful examination of the data 
shows that peaks in these four datasets are correlated. 
The peaks from different datasets tend to occur at the same locations in the genome. 
This correlation can be potentially used to improve statistical inference. 
For example, the weak peak highlighted by the solid box in the first dataset 
in Figure 1(a) cannot be easily distinguished from background noise if 
one looks at this dataset alone. However, if all datasets are analyzed together, 
the observation that all other datasets have strong peaks at the same location 
suggests that the weak peak in the first dataset is a real binding site. 
By contrast, the peak highlighted by the dashed box has approximately 
the same magnitude in the first dataset, but no binding signal has been 
observed in the other datasets, suggesting that it is less likely to be a real binding signal. 
When multiple datasets are analyzed jointly, it is also important to keep in 
mind that some TFB are condition-specific. For example, the genomic location 
shown in Figure 1(b) has strong binding signal only in the second dataset.
In this case, even without referring to the other datasets, the enrichment
 is strong enough and should be called a peak. In this case, we should also 
avoid claiming that other datasets have peaks at this region only because 
there is a strong peak in the second dataset. Ideally, there should be 
a mechanism that automatically integrates and weighs different pieces of information, 
then ranks peaks according to the combined evidence.

Figure 1: Motivation of JAMIE. (a) Four Gli ChIP-chip datasets show cooccurrence 
of binding sites at the same genomic locus. This correlation may help distinguish 
real and false TFBSs. Each bar in the plot corresponds to a probe. 
Height of the bar is the log2 ratio between IP and control intensities.

<h3 id="method"><b>Method</b></h3>
<p>
To capture the locational correlation among datasets, 
we introduced the concept of potential binding region (PBR), 
which is defined as a genomic region can potentially be bound by some TFs. 
We further assumed that the active binding event for a dataset 
depends on condition such as cellular context, but they can only happen at the PBRs.
<p>
Based on these assumptions, we proposed a hierarchical model, as illustrated in Figure 2,
to jointly model data from multiple chip-chips. Assume the genome 
is split into non-overlapping window of a certain length, such as 1000 bps. 
At the top level we assumed that a priori, a window can become a PBR with 
probability &pi;, or become background with probability 1-&pi;. 
We define B<sub>i</sub> to be the indicator for the ith window being PBR or not. 
At the next level, if a window is a PBR, in dataset d, we assume it can either 
become an active binding site with probability q<sub>d</sub>, 
or remain silent with probability 1-q<sub>d</sub>. 
A<sub>id</sub> is defined to indicate the active binding 
event for window i in dataset d. We assume that conditional on B<sub>i</sub>=1, 
A<sub>id</sub>'s are independent, 
or the active binding events are independent among datasets at PBRs. 
At the next level, the chip-chip signals, as denoted by <b>Y</b>, 
are generated according to the active binding status in each dataset. 
If there is no active binding, the probe signals are from background distribution. 
If there is active binding, there will be a peak in the region.
But instead of forcing the peak to occupy the whole region, 
we assumed that the peak  can be of any length and at
any relative location within the PBR. This assumption allows much 
flexibility because some TFs 
bind at the same gene promoter but recognize different DNA motifs, so their peaks don't
exactly overlap. Finally, we assume the probe signals follow two different distributions, 
f<sub>0</sub> for backgrounds and f<sub>1</sub> for peaks. 
In this model, we observed <b>Y</b>, 
the probe signals. B<sub>i</sub> and A<sub>id</sub> are missing indicators. 
Model parameters are &pi;, q<sub>d</sub>'s, 
and probe distributions f<sub>0</sub> and f<sub>1</sub>.

<p>
Based on the model,  the joint likelihood of the observed and missing data
can be derived and  the parameters are estimated via EM algorithm (Dempster <i>et al</i> 1977).
We then scan the genome by the joint model and 
compute the posterior probabilities of each probe starting a peak. 
The peaks then can be detected and ranked from these posterior probabilities.

<h3 id="implementation"><b>Implementation</b></h3><br>
JAMIE was implemented as an R package. The engine functions were written in C 
for better performance. It takes CEL and BPMAP files (for Affymetrix tiling arrays) 
or a single text file (all other platforms) for raw intensities, 
and a text configuration file. In two lines of R code, JAMIE will output 
a list of peaks ranked by their posterior probabilities for each dataset. 
<p>
JAMIE provides reasonable performance although
the computation is much more intensive compared to some other
ChIP-chip peak detection software such as TileMap (Ji <i>et al.</i> 2005) or
MAT (Johnson <i>et al.</i> 2006).
In a test run with four datasets, 
each with 3 IP, 3 control and 3.8 millions probes, 
the whole analysis took around 15 minutes on a PC 
running Linux with 2.2GHz CPU and 4G RAM.
