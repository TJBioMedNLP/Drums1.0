<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>Malin is a software package for the analysis of eukaryotic 
gene structure evolution. 
It provides a graphical user interface for various tasks 
commonly used
to infer the evolution of exon-intron structure 
in protein-coding orthologs. 
The implemented tasks include the following.</p>
<ul>
<li> Identification of homologous splice sites in annotated 
	protein sequence alignments.</li>
<li>Computation of primary statistics about introns in 
	homologous sites (<q>shared introns</q>).</li>
<li>Estimation of ancestral intron content, intron losses and 
	gains by Dollo parsimony.</li>
<li>Estimation of intron loss and gain rates in a probabilistic model.</li>
<li>Estimation of ancestral intron content, intron losses and gains 
	in a probabilistic model.</li>
<li>Inference of evolutionary histories at individual sites.</li>
<li>Error estimation for rates and histories by bootstrap.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Related stuff</h2>
<p>My other related computer programs (including a program for multiple 
	alignment of intron-annotated protein sequences) and information is 
	accessible through <a href="../index.html">my research page</a> on intron evolution.
</p>
<p>Liran Carmel wrote a spiffy software 
	package called EREM (Evolutionary Reconstruction by Expectation-Maximization), 
	which implements his results on analyzing gene structure evolution. 
	See <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Fellows/Carmel/software/EREM/erem.html">his webpage</a>
	about it.
</p>

<h1>Availability</h1>
<p>Malin is written entirely in Java, and, thus, can be used 
in different operating systems, including Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, 
and various Unix/Linux versions. 
The software is packaged in a JAR file, and can be executed 
in Java versions 1.5 and above.
The distributed platform-specific packages, described below, 
include the JAR file with the necessary 
bundling for execution, as well as 
the User's Guide and a <tt>test</tt> directory.
</p>

<h2>Version history</h2>
<ul>
<li>2008 April 13 (<b>current</b>) version adds 
	the option of closing a session, and 
	improves the Help information.</li>
<li>2008 February 29 version fixed 
a bug from the previous version that prevented the proper 
saving of intron site mapping information in intron tables. 
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mac OS X</h2>
<p>I have written the software using a Mac, and 
went to some extent to integrate the Java executable into a native-looking 
application. The JAR file is bundled as <tt>Malin.app</tt>, which you can just 
run directly by double-clicking on it. Please note that the 
application attempts to set the memory usage for the Java Virtual Machine 
by enabling a maximum heap size of 1000 Megabytes. If your computer does not have 
that much memory (i.e., at least 1G), the application may not function properly. 
One solution is to follow the instructions for Unix/Linux below, 
and launch Malin from a Terminal window. Alternatively, you can send me an e-mail 
and I will gladly prepare a small-memory version of the application  for you.</p>
<p><span class="partitle">Installation:</span> 
Download the disk image <a href="./Malin.dmg"><tt>Malin.dmg</tt></a>, open it, 
and place the application <tt>Malin.app</tt> 
into an appropriate directory. For convenience, you may want to copy it to the 
<tt>Applications</tt> folder, either at the system level, 
or in your own home directory.</p>

<h2>Microsoft Windows</h2>
<p>
You need to have a Java Virtual Machine 
on your computer in order to run Malin. You could download, for instance, 
Sun's Java Runtime Environment from <a href="http://www.java.com/">http://www.java.com/</a>, 
which is 
the JRE I used in the testing. 
You will probably need to enable larger memory usage for the 
JVM than the default setting, which you get by double-clicking on the JAR file. 
You can launch Malin via the provided MS-DOS batch file that sets the 
heap space for the JVM to 1000 Megabytes. Edit the batch file manually, 
if necessary.</p>
<p>
<span class="partitle">Installation:</span>  
Download the ZIP file <a href="./Malin.zip"><tt>Malin.zip</tt></a>. The 
archive contains the 
JAR file <a href="./Malin.jar"><tt>Malin.jar</tt></a> and the batch file 
<tt>Malin.bat</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Unix/Linux</h2>
<p>You can launch Malin from the command line, 
by the command <kbd>java -jar Malin.jar</kbd>. 
You will probably need to enable larger memory usage for the 
JVM than the default setting, which you can do by 
launching Malin as <kbd>java -Xmx1024M -jar Malin.jar</kbd>. 
The <tt>-Xmx</tt> option here sets the Java heap space to 1 Gigabytes: you
can experiment with other settings appropriate  for your computer and 
data set.</p>

<p>
<span class="partitle">Installation:</span>  
Download the gzipped TAR file <a href="./Malin.tgz"><tt>Malin.tgz</tt></a> into an 
appropriate directory. You can extract the files from the archive
with the command <kbd>tar -zxf Malin.tgz</kbd>.
</p>

<h2>User's Guide</h2>
<p>The User's Guide is available in PDF format
as <a href="./malin_guide.pdf">malin_guide.pdf</a>. 
Relevant information is available also through the Help menu of the 
software package.</p>

you'd have my promise of notifying you about future updates.)
