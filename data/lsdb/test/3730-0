<B>Previous news:</B><BR>
11/8/98 - A new enhanced version of Figure 5 is <A HREF="http://cmgm.stanford.edu/pbrown/sporulation/figures/fig5ss.html">now available</A>. The changes are as follows: readable <B>gene names</B> for each row! Accurate coloring, 3 <B>separate sizes</B> (including poster-size), easier-to-read URS1 and MSE binding site "<B>gradient bars</B>." The complete data, in spreadsheet form, will be up soon. New enhancements to the database are coming soon as well. 
<B>10/27/98</B> New fields in the detailed reports section. Includes up to date SGD gene names and definitions. Links to SGD and YPD added. More to come. <BR>
<B>10/26/98</B> Moved the database over to a new server. Added Links. I will be implementing additions to the search page, as well as more data. Stay Tuned!<BR>
<B>10/23/98</B> The high-detail reports on individual genes are now active. A help page for viewing the search results has also been added.<BR>
<B>10/22/98</B> The database is up and running, however, high-detail reports on individual genes are not yet active. I hope to have this, as well as the additional figures up in the next couple of days.<BR>
<B>10/21/98</B> All links are active except additional figures and the database/guestbook. I plan to have these up tomorrow evening. We have several very interesting figures which we will be adding on a continual basis to this site. Bookmark it and visit often.<BR>
