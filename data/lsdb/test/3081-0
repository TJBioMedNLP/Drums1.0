APID (Agile Protein Interaction DataAnalizer) is a bioinformatic web application tool that has been developed to allow exploration
and analysis of main currently databases about protein protein interactions integrated and unified in a common and comparative platform.
APID database has been set up after the analysis of several available databases of protein-protein interactions. At present time,
it includes the information from five main source databases: DIP (Database of Interacting Proteins), BIND
(Biomolecular Interaction Network Database), IntAct (Database system and analysis tools for protein interaction data),
MINT (Molecular Interactions Database) and HPRD (Human Protein Reference Database).
APID can be explored in an interactive way via open web access, and also includes a graphic tool to visualize and browse
upon the interactions network. This tool is called APIN (Agile Protein Interaction Navigator).
The APIN bioinformatic tool reads data from a selected set of interactions and displays the proteins and interactions in an interactive
customizable way, like a browser. In this way, using an intuitive and clear interface one can navigate into complex
interactome networks focusing on some areas, or on some specific proteins, by applying restrictions to the queried data.
