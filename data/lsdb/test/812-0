<p>
Following is a list of software produced by this lab which is
being made available for use by the genomics community.
<ol> 
<li><a href=ESTprep3.1.4.tar.gz><b>ESTprep3.1.4</b></a>
    (released on January 10, 2003).
This program is used
to pre-process EST reads in a mixed-tissue library environment. The
software is written in C and designed to run under the UNIX operating
system. Only standard C and libraries are needed so this package
should be able to run on most operating systems. ESTprep has been successfully
used on Linux, Solaris, Windows (98, NT), and Mac OS X.
You may view

<a href=ESTprep3.1.tar.gz><b>ESTprep3.1</b></a> (released on June 15, 2001).<br>
<a href=ESTprep1.1.tar.gz><b>ESTprep1.1</b></a> (released on May 14, 1998).<br>

<br>These files contain predetermined set of library tags for use with prep's double error detection and single error
correction capabilities. The double error detection feature finds invalid library tag markers. The single error correction feature detects library tags containing one error and produces it valid counterpart.

<li><a href=RHScorer1.0.tar.gz><b>RHScorer1.0</b></a>(released on September 1, 1998). This tool is used to score gels...The software is written entirely in Java.It consists of client applet and a server.The server is used to 
maintain the Gel Images and scores. The applet is used to score the gels.

<li><a href=RHScorer2.1.tar.gz><b>RHScorer2.1</b></a>(released on Mar 10,1999).
<br>CHANGES from the version 2.0
<br>
* Added the ability to load the previous scores if the gel
  is already scored. Refer the CHANGES file to use the new feature

<br><br>
<li><a href=tlcluster.tar.gz><b>tlcluster</b></a> This program is used to perform clustering on fasta formatted sequences.  The program is written in C and designed to run under the UNIX operating system. Only
      standard C and UNIX libraries are needed so this package should be able to run on almost any UNIX installation.<br><a href=tlhistogram.tar.gz><b>tlhistogram</b></a> complements tlcluster by providing some statistics that result from tlcluster.  Written in C.<br>

<li> <a href="clustering/index.html"><b>Clustering @ CLCG</b></a><br>
<a href="uicluster2.1.1.tar.gz"><b>uicluster2.1.1</b></a> 
This program is an updated version of tlcluster that is much faster and adds new
features such as reverse complement checking. In addition to optimization and reverse
checking, it performs an extended search of all primaries for each sequence being
clustered. The program is written in C and 
designed to run under the UNIX operating system. Only standard C and UNIX 
libraries are needed so this package should be able to run on almost any UNIX 
installation.<br>
<a href="uicluster3.0.5.tar.gz"><b>uicluster3.0.5</b></a>
This is the latest version of uicluster, which improves on its predecessor by 
adding parallel execution capabilties. The parallelism is implemented using MPICH MPI 
library. <br>
</li>

<br><br>
<li><a href=UITagCreator1.9.tar.gz><b>UITagCreator1.9</b></a>(released
on July 22th, 2002)
<br>
UITagCreator is used for the creation of fixed-length pooled library tags
for EST-Based Gene Discovery. The software is written in C and designed to
run under the UNIX operating system. Only standard C and UNIX libraries are
needed so this package should be able to run on almost any UNIX installation. 
<br>
<a href=UITC-README>Installation and Documentation</a>
<br> 
This <a href=taginfo/Tags-H5-E3.txt>file</a> contains a set of 288
tags currently in use at the University of Iowa. Each tag is Hamming
distance 5 and edit distance 3 from all others. 
<!--Identification Software ESTprep may prove useful in conjunction with created tag sets
and is downloadable <a href = ESTprep1.1.tar.gz>here</a>. -->
