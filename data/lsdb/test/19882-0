<h2> ARCS: An Aggregated Related Column Scoring Scheme for Aligned Sequences </h2>

<hr>
<p>
<b>Motivation</b>: Biologists frequently align multiple sequences to determine consensus sequences or look for predominant residues or conserved regions.
In particular, determining conserved regions in an alignment is one of the most important activities,
but it is determined manually by experts in most cases.
Since protein sequences are often several-hundred residues or longer,
it is difficult to distinguish biologically important conserved regions (motifs or domains) from others.
The widely used tools, Logos and information content, often fail to highlight such regions.
Thus a computational tool that can highlight biologically important regions with a higher accuracy will be significant.

<p><b>Results</b>: This paper presents a new score scheme ARCS (Aggregated Related Column Score) for aligned biological sequences
and designs an algorithm based on ARCS to highlight the reserved regions among aligned sequences.
In an extensive experimental evaluation using 533 PROSITE patterns,
ARCS was able to highlight the motif regions with up to 82% accuracy.
