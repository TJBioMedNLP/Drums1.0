Computational prediction of signal peptides (SPs) and their cleavage sites is of great importance in computational biology; however, currently there is no available method capable of predicting reliably the SPs of archaea, due to the limited amount of experimentally verified proteins with SPs. 
<p>We performed an extensive literature search in order to identify archaeal proteins having experimentally verified SP and managed to find 69 such proteins, the largest number ever reported. A detailed analysis of these sequences revealed some unique features of the SPs of archaea, such as the unique amino acid composition of the hydrophobic region with a higher than expected occurrence of isoleucine, and a cleavage site resembling more the sequences of gram-positives with almost equal amounts of alanine and valine at the position-3 before the cleavage site and a dominant alanine at position-1, followed in abundance by serine and glycine. <p>Using these proteins as a training set, we trained a hidden Markov model method that predicts the presence of the SPs and their cleavage sites and also discriminates such proteins from cytoplasmic and transmembrane ones.
