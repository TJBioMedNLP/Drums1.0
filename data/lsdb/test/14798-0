<h3>Rule-Based Mediation</h3>

<p>
    The Integrative Bioinformatics Group, headed by
    <a href="http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/people/home.php?id=91">Neil Wipat</a> and part of The Centre for
    Integrated Systems Biology of Ageing and Nutrition (CISBAN), has developed a semantic data integration system
    called rule-based mediation. The creation of accurate quantitative Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models is
    a time-intensive, manual process often complicated by the many data sources and formats required to annotate
    even a small and well-scoped model. Ideally, the retrieval and integration of biological knowledge for model
    annotation should be performed quickly, precisely, and with a minimum of manual effort.
</p>

<p>
    Rule-based mediation is a method of semantic data integration applied to systems biology
    model annotation. The heterogeneous data sources are first syntactically converted into ontologies, which are
    then aligned to a small domain ontology by applying a rule base. We have demonstrated proof-of-principle of this
    application of rule-based mediation using off-the-shelf semantic web technology through two use cases for SBML
    model annotation. Through the use of existing tools, development time is decreased and usability is increased.
    Integrating resources in this way accommodates multiple formats with different semantics, and
    provides richly-modelled biological knowledge suitable for annotation of SBML models. We have
    established the feasibility of this approach as part of an automated SBML model annotation system, and are working
    on extending this system to provide larger-scale integration.
</p>

<p>
    In short, rule-based mediation has a number of defining features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>the data from syntactically and semantically different data sources are materialised within a core ontology for
        easy access and stable querying;
    </li>
    <li>the core ontology is a semantically-meaningful model of the biological domain of interest;</li>
    <li> implementation can be performed using off-the-shelf tools and mapping languages.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessing Project Files</h3>

<p>
    To view the entire integrated schema, you will need to download two Subversion projects:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The Rule-Based Mediation Project
        <!--(<a href="http://metagenome.ncl.ac.uk/websvn/listing.php?repname=rule-based-mediation">browse SVN</a>),-->
        (<a href="http://metagenome.ncl.ac.uk/subversion/rule-based-mediation">browse SVN</a>),
        accessible from<br>
        <code>svn checkout http://metagenome.ncl.ac.uk/subversion/rule-based-mediation/telomere/trunk
            rule-based-mediation</code>
    </li>
    <li>The Model Format OWL (MFO) Project, accessible from<br>
        <code>svn checkout http://metagenome.ncl.ac.uk/subversion/MFO/trunk MFO</code>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The rest of the instructions on this page assume you are working from within a local checkout of the rule-based
    mediation project.
</p>

<h4>File Types</h4>

<p>
    *.owl are the ontology files themselves in OWL-DL format.
    The *.pprj files are the Protege project files, which you may find useful. Protege allows you to open an
    ontology directly by opening its .owl file, or indirectly by opening the .pprj file. By loading via the pprj
    file, you are loading preferences that were set in a previous Protege session and stored in the .pprj file.
    The *.repository file contains information for Protege about where to find external ontologies locally. In the
    case of rule-based mediation, you may wish to manually edit this file to ensure that it is pointing to the
    correct local files, though sensible defaults have been provided. Relative or absolute paths may be used.
</p>


<h4>Viewing and Manipulating Project Files</h4>

<p>
    The majority of the project is composed of OWL ontologies. You may use any OWL-compatible editor to view these
    files. We recommend the freely-available <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/">Protege 3.4</a>. While other
    editors should be fine, this is the editor that has been used in-house.
</p>

<p>
    Information about each of the ontologies is available in the directories' README.txt files. However, to get you
    started, if you wish to view the asserted set of classes and instances stored in the core ontology, then
    you should load <code>main/resources/ontologies/integratedschema/is-container.owl</code>. If you are using
    Protege 3.4, then you should select the <code>is-container.pprj</code> file instead, as it will make loading of the
    ontology easier. All imported ontologies for <code>is-container</code> are available locally, in this project or
    in the MFO project. Using the <code>.pprj</code> file will bypass you needing to manually state where the imported
    ontologies reside.
</p>

<p>
    <em>
        Important: the <code>is-container</code> ontology assumes that the MFO project is in the same directory as
        the RBM project. If MFO is in a different directory, then you will need to open the is-container.repository file
        and change the lines for <code>SBO_OWL.owl</code> and <code>MFO.owl</code> to point to their actual location.
    </em>
