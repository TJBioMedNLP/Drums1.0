<P><strong>Abstract</strong>
<blockquote>
  <p>A major challenge for genomewide disease association 
    studies is the high cost of genotyping large num-ber of single nucleotide 
    polymorphisms (SNP). The correlations between SNPs, however, make it possible 
    to select a parsimonious set of informative SNPs, known as “tagging” SNPs, 
    able to capture most variation in a popula-tion. Considerable research interest 
    has recently focused on the development of methods for finding such SNPs.
    In this paper we present an efficient method for finding tagging 
    SNPs. The method does not involve computation-intensive search for SNP subsets 
    but discards redundant SNPs using a feature selection algorithm. In contrast 
    to most existing methods, the method presented here does not limit itself 
    to using only correlations between SNPs in local groups. By using correlations 
    that occur across different chromosomal regions, the method can reduce the 
    number of globally re-dundant SNPs. Experimental results show that the number 
    of tagging SNPs selected by our method is smaller than by using block-based 
    approaches.</p>
