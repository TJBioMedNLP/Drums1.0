<b>Abstract</b></h3>

Evolutionarily conserved non-coding genomic sequences represent a
potentially rich source for the discovery of gene regulatory region
such as transcriptional enhancers. However, detecting orthologous
enhancers using alignment-based methods in higher eukaryotic genomes
is particularly challenging, as regulatory regions can undergo
considerable sequence changes while maintaining their functionality.
We have developed an alignment-free method which identifies conserved
enhancers in multiple diverged species. Our method is based on
similarity metrics between two sequences based on the co-occurrence of
sequence patterns regardless of their order and orientation, thus
tolerating sequence changes observed in non-coding evolution.  We show
that our method is highly successful in detecting orthologous
enhancers in distantly related species without requiring additional
information such as knowledge about transcription factors involved, or
predicted binding sites.  By estimating the significance of similarity
scores, we are able to discriminate experimentally validated
functional enhancers from seemingly equally conserved candidates
without function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on
a wide range of enhancers in Drosophila, and also present encouraging
results to detect conserved functional regions across large
evolutionary distances. Our work provides encouraging steps on the way
to ab initio unbiased enhancer prediction to complement ongoing
experimental efforts.

<h3>
<b> Description </b></h3>

This method searches for orthologous enhancer region in a related species for a given known enhancer.

<p>
 Input sequences are read from a fasta file, repeats and the low-complexity regions in the control sequences are masked. This method identifies conserved enhancers in related species in a non-alignment fashion. All possible patterns of a given window are enumerated for evaluation of their contribution to the overall similarity measure. The number of instances of each pattern in both sequences explains its contribution of the total similarity between them [1].
</p>
<p>
The given known enhancer region is scanned against the control region in a pairwise sliding window fashion in both strands. The mixed metric score is computed for each window that generates a similarity profile. The window with the global maximum mixed metric score is considered and the consecutive windows that exceeds the threshold value are merged. The region that exceeds the threshold value is reported as a potential orthologous enhancer region in the related species.

<p>
This method is evaluated by applying to different data sets demonstrated the flexibility of the alignment-free method [2] [3] [4] [5].
