<meta name="description" content="Several methods for establishing
cross-links between PDB structures or SCOP domains and Swiss-Prot + TrEMBL
sequences (or vice versa) rely on databases annotations. Alternatively,
sequence alignment procedures can be used. In this report, we describe
Seq2Struct, a web resource for the identification of sequence-structure
links. The resource consists of an exhaustive collection of annotated links
between Swiss-Prot + TrEMBL and PDB + SCOP database entries. Links are based
on pre-established highly-reliable thresholds and stored in a relational
database, which has been enhanced with annotation derived from Swiss-Prot,
PDB, SCOP, GOA and DSSP databases. The Seq2Struct database contents,
supported by a WWW web interface, can be both queried on line and
downloaded.">
