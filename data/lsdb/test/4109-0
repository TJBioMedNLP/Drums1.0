<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<p><b>Motivation</b>: Array comparative genomic hybridization (ArrayCGH) is widely 
used to measure DNA copy numbers in cancer research. ArrayCGH data report log-ratio 
intensities of thousands of probes sampled along the chromosomes. Typically, the 
choices of the locations and the lengths of the probes vary in different experiments. 
This discrepancy in choosing probes poses a challenge in integrated classification 
or analysis across multiple arrayCGH datasets. We propose an alignment based framework 
to integrate arrayCGH samples generated from different probe sets. The alignment 
framework seeks an optimal alignment between the probe series of one arrayCGH sample 
and the probe series of another sample, intended to find the maximum possible overlap 
of DNA copy number variations between the two measured chromosomes. An alignment 
kernel is introduced for integrative patient sample classification and a multiple 
alignment algorithm is also introduced for identifying common regions with copy 
number aberrations.</p>
<p><b>Results</b>: The probe alignment kernel and the multiple probe alignment algorithm 
were experimented to integrate three bladder cancer datasets as well as artificial 
datasets. In the experiments, by integrating arrayCGH samples from multiple datasets, 
the probe alignment kernel used with support vector machines significantly improved 
patient sample classification accuracy over other baseline kernels. The experiments 
also demonstrated that the multiple probe alignment algorithm can find common DNA 
aberrations that cannot be identified with the standard interpolation method. Furthermore, 
the multiple probe alignment algorithm also identified many known bladder cancer 
DNA aberrations containing four known bladder cancer genes, three of which cannot 
be detected by interpolation.</p>
