<h1>Profile Alignment</h1>
Profile-profile scoring and alignment is analogous to pairwise sequence comparison, except that the objects being compared are profiles: matrices of real values, representing the probability of amino acids at each position in a corresponding multiple sequence alignment. Our experiments show that profile-profile methods can provide greater sensitivity in homolog recognition and also more accurate alignments of pairs of protein sequences, and also (modest) improvements over alignments of individual sequences to profiles.
