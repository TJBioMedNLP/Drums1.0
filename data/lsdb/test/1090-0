Cheminformatics  / Chemoinformatics - This website contains links to cheminformatics programs and some QSAR datasets (with structures!) which accumulated during my PhD. All programs should be free to use, at least for academics. For a computational chemistry mailing list, see www.ccl.net, the QSAR society with additional resources can be found at www.qsar.org.
