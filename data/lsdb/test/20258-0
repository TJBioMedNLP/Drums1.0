<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>

<p>Thank you for your interest in PhyloNet. This software package is developed
and maintained by the <a href="http://bioinfo.cs.rice.edu/"><b>BioInformatics
Group</b></a> at the Department of Computer Science at Rice University.
PhyloNet is aimed mainly at providing a suite of tools for reconstructing and
analyzing reticulate (non-treelike) evolutionary relationships. In particular,
the software package includes features for inferring horizontal gene transfer
from a pair of species/gene trees, and detecting interspecific recombination
breakpoints in a sequence alignment. Further, it has the capabilities for
reading/storing phylogenetic networks, and comparing phylogenetic networks
topologies. As the algorithms for phylogenetic network reconstruction and
evaluation make use of algorithmic techniques from the domain of phylogenetic
trees, the package also contains several tree-oriented features, such as
modules for computing the maximum agreement subtrees, the Robinson-Foulds
distance measures, etc.</p>

<p><b>This work is supported in part by a National Science Foundation grant
(CCF-0622037), a Department of Energy grant (DE-FG02-06ER25734), and grant
R01LM009494 from the National Library of Medicine. The contents are solely the
responsibility of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official
views of the DOE, NSF, National Library of Medicine or the National Institutes
of Health.</b></p>

<p>PhyloNet is developed entirely in Java, making it platform independent. To
obtain a copy of the tool, download the most recent version from the <a
href="#Downloads">Downloads</a> section below. Installation and usage
instructions can be found in the <i>User Documentation</i> associated with the
release downloaded.</p>

<p>You may also be interested in the <a
href="http://bioinfo.cs.rice.edu/nepal">NEPAL</a> tool for
phylogenetic network reconstruction and evaluation using the maximum parsimony
(MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) criteria. </p>

<p>The PhyloNet software package is currently under heavy development and 
improvements (including a GUI, and a myriad of new features); once these 
are done, the whole package will be made 
available in open-source. If you would like to report bugs, comments, or questions, please
<a href="mailto:nakhleh@cs.rice.edu">contact us</a> or fill out
our <a href="#Feedback">feedback survey</a>.</p>

<h3>RELEASE NOTES</h3>
<h4>PhyloNet Version 2.3</h4>

<p><i>Release Date:</i> 11/09/2010</p>

<h4>PhyloNet Version 2.2</h4>

<p><i>Release Date:</i> 9/21/2010</p>
<p>The new species inference tools are now available from the graphical 
interface as well as from the command-line. Bugs with the graphical interface have also been fixed.</p>

<h4>PhyloNet Version 2.1</h4>

<p>The package now contains more methods to infer species trees, including MDC, MDC with time, GLASS, extended Majority Consensus. They are included in <tt>infer_st</tt> tool. Details are described in user manual. New features are only available from command line, not GUI now.</p>

<h4>PhyloNet Version 2.0</h4>

<p><i>Release Date:</i> 11/9/2009</p>
<p>The package now includes a graphical user interface, which provides easier
access to most of the command-line functionality. A new chapter in the user manual
explains the basics of the new interface.</p>

<h4>PhyloNet Version 1.7</h4>

<p><i>Release Date:</i> 10/18/2009</p>
<p>The DP tool for inferring species trees from multiple gene trees now
can handle multiple-allele gene trees, as well as non-binary gene trees.</p>

<p><i>Release Date:</i> 06/15/2009</p>
<p>The package contains a new tool for inferring the species tree from gene
trees using the MDC criterion. The new tool uses dynamic programming for
species tree inference, and CPLEX is not needed.</p>

<h4>PhyloNet Version 1.6</h4>

<p><i>Release Date:</i> 12/12/2008</p>
<p>The package contains a bug fix in the tool for inferring the species
from gene trees despite lineage sorting.</p>

<p><i>Release Date:</i> 10/20/2008</p>
<p>The package now has a tool to infer the species tree from gene trees
despite lineage sorting.</p>

<h4>PhyloNet Version 1.5</h4>

<p><i>Release Date:</i> 07/04/2008</p>
<p>The package now accepts trees with both the distances and bootstrap
values (see the manual for more details).</p>

<p><i>Release Date:</i> 05/24/2008</p>
<p>The tool RiataHgt in Phylonet version 1.5 can now output networks in both
formats: eNewick and the edge-list format. After computing HGT events for a
set of gene trees, RiataHgt now offers a consensus network in the edge-list
format.</p>

<p><i>Release Date:</i> 02/28/2008</p>
<p>Phylonet version 1.5 now comes with a capability to visualize HGT
events.</p>

<p><i>Release Date:</i> 12/19/2007</p>
<p>PhyloNet version 1.5 includes a new tool for generating a mixed integer
linear programming formula that can be solved by CPLEX. The new tool thus
allows the user to reconstruct the species tree from a large dataset by using
a highly efficient CPLEX program. </p>

<h4>PhyloNet Version 1.4</h4>

<p><i>Release Date:</i> 08/17/2007</p>
<p>PhyloNet version 1.4 allows the tool Riata-HGT to evaluate the confidence
(or bootstrap) of events it computes. The method for obtaining bootstrap
values of events is still under ongoing refinement. You can get the latest
stable verion of PhyloNet without event bootstrap <a
href="downloads/releases/v1.3/phylonet_v1_3.zip">here</a>.
</p>

<h4>PhyloNet Version 1.3</h4>

<p><i>Release Date:</i> 08/03/2007</p>
<p>PhyloNet version 1.3 implements new techniques for handling caterpillars in
trees, thus significantly reducing running time for computing HGT.</p>

<h4>PhyloNet Version 1.2</h4>

<p><i>Release Date:</i> 10/30/2006</p>
<p>The new release comes with a set of sample input files, and a README file
that illustrates the use of different tools with these input files. The tool
Riata-HGT was also modified to run on files that contains a species tree and
one or more gene trees. Further, the package now includes the COUNTCOAL
utility, which enumerates all valid coalescent scenarios of a gene within the
branches of a species tree (both species and gene trees are givens as input).
</p>

<p><i>Release Date:</i> 10/9/2006</p>
<p>The tool Riata-HGT is modified and extended to find more solutions and to
run more efficiently. Events detected by Riata-HGT are now grouped by
components, so that they are easier to analyze. The tool for characterizing
phylogenetic networks in terms of tripartitions has also been corrected. </p>

<p><i>Release Date:</i> 8/29/2006</p>
<p>The tool now allows for scoring the parsimony of phylogenetic networks
given sequences at their leaves. The current implementation allows only for
Hamming distances (i.e., the distance between two equal-length sequences is
the number of positions in which they differ). Weighted Hamming distances,
allowing also for different substitution matrices, will be implemented in the
future.</p>

<h4>PhyloNet Version 1.1</h4>

<p><i>Release Date:</i> 8/25/2006</p>
<p>This release adds support for phylogenetic networks. The package contains
tools for reading and writing phylogenetic networks in the eNewick format. It
also has tools for characterizing networks (i.e., computing clusters, trees,
and tripartitions contained in a network), and for computing the distance
between two networks. </p>

<h4>PhyloNet Version 1.0</h4>

<p><i>Release Date:</i> 8/21/2006</p>
<p>This release has the same functionality as found in Sequoia Version 1.1.2.
The two packages have been merged in order to provide additional support for
phylogenetic networks in the near future.</p>
