<h1>
Introduction</h1>
Welcome to the <a href="http://www-ksl.stanford.edu/kst/what-is-an-ontology.html">ontologies</a>
for ethology page, documenting a project to develop knowledge representation,
including ontologies, as tools for describing and analyzing animal behavior.&nbsp;
The project is currently developing a set of ontologies for courtship 
behavior in a clade of <i>Habronattus</i> jumping spiders from raw
video of behavior sequences.&nbsp; Ultimately, a small library of 
such knowledge bases will serve as sample data to develop methods for 
comparative studies and (secondarily) other varieties of linking between knowledge bases 
across behavior studies.  The plan is to eventually provide these 
comparative tools into the <a href="http://www.mesquiteproject.org/">Mesquite</a>
tool.
<p>The purpose of this project is not to propose a particular upper-level
or coding for ontologies, but to demonstrate ontology construction as a general
technique for coding ethograms and other descriptions of behavior into
machine understandable forms.&nbsp; As such, it is intended to encompass,
rather than serve as an alternative to, previous attempts <sup><a href="#1.">1</a>,<a href="#2.">2</a></sup>&nbsp;
at formalizing the description of behavior.</p>
<p>The goals of this project differ from efforts such as those of the Gene
Ontology Consortium.&nbsp; This project is more focused on representing
and coding descriptions, rather than using ontologies as a semantic level
of metadata for linking entities in existing databases.&nbsp; Part of this
reflects the small number of data sources in this project.&nbsp; A plan
to work on the integration across sources of description is coming in the
near future.</p>

<h1>
 Ontology Updates
</h1>
<p>
I have updated the files for the <em>H. californicus</em> courtship ontology.  The generated html, as
well as the Protege (frames) source and project files, have been updated to Protege 3.4 (build 519).
</p>
<h1 class = "newText">New Tools</h1>
<p>
Phylontal is a library with a GUI application frontend for aligning phenotype ontologies (e.g.,
behavior, anatomy) based on a phylogeny.  It is still under development, but status updates are available
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/phylontal/wiki/HomePage">here</a>.
</p>
<h1>Existing tools</h1>
<p>
Looking for information about OwlWatcher or EOLite?  
Try <a href="http://ethotools.sourceforge.net/">here</a>.
Current OwlWatcher status: OSX support still broken, Windows versions 0.036 and 0.04 will work with
older versions of Apple's Quicktime for Windows.  New version with video support from Xuggler and
using the OWLAPI v 3 (with OWL2 support) is in progress.
</p>

<h1>Presentations</h1>
Several ontology related presentations, generally available as MS PowerPoint or generated HTML pages, are
available <a href="Presentations/index.html">here</a>.
<h1>
Sample Ontologies</h1>
This site currently includes two ontologies developed as part of this 
project.  

<h2>
Loggerhead Nesting   <a href="Loggerhead_1.jpg">
    <img border="0"
     src="Loggerhead_1.jpg"
        alt="Loggerhead" height="52" width="85"/></a>
</h2>
An ontology for Loggerhead sea turtle (<i>Caretta
caretta</i>) nesting behavior, based on the published ethogram of Hailman
and Elowson<sup><a href="#3.">3</a></sup> is available in three forms: &nbsp;  
<ol start="1">
    <li>An <a href="Loggerhead/abbreviated/index.html">abbreviated ontology</a> (just concept classes) 
    of the actions and states in the ontology.  This is rendered in HTML with one page 
    for each concept defined in the ontology.  This is the recommended place for people 
    who know about behavior, but not about ontologies, to start.</li>
    <li>A <a href="Loggerhead/index.html">complete dump</a> of the ontology 
    and knowledge base as a HTML tree - one page for each concept and instance.</li>
    <li><a href="Loggerhead/protege_source">Protege-2000 source (CLIPS) files</a> - you will need 
    the <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/index.html">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-2000</a> 
    editor to use these files.   Brief directions for loading them are <a
    href="Protege_howto.html">here</a>. </li>
</ol>

<h3>History</h3>
This Prot&eacute;g&eacute; version is a revised version of the Loom based ontology presented in posters at
the Evolution 2001 and <a href="http://www.animalbehavior.org/ABS/Program/Past/OSU_01/Symps/AbstractsL_Z.pdf">Animal
Behavior 2001</a> meetings.&nbsp; Further updates to this ontology may
be posted from time to time. 

<p>Substantial updates to the Loggerhead ontology were made during December 
2001 and September 2002.</p>

<h2>
<i>Habronattus</i> Courtship <a href="Habronattus.jpg">
    <img border="0"
     src="Habronattus.jpg"
        alt="Habronattus" height="52" width="85"/></a>

</h2>
A draft version of an ontology for <i>Habronattus californicus</i> 
courtship is available in three formats:

<ol start="1">
    <li>An <a href="Habronattus/abbreviated/index.html">abbreviated ontology</a> (just concept classes) 
    of the actions and states in the ontology.  This is rendered in HTML with one page 
    for each concept defined in the ontology.  This is the recommended place for people 
    who know about behavior, but not about ontologies, to start.</li>
    <li>A <a href="Habronattus/index.html">complete dump</a> of the ontology 
    and knowledge base as a HTML tree - one page for each concept and instance.</li>
    <li><a href="Habronattus/Protege_source">Protege-2000 source (CLIPS) files</a> - you will need 
    the <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/index.html">Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-2000</a> 
    editor to use these files.</li>
</ol>
<h3>History</h3>
This ontology is part of an ongoing comparative study of courtship 
behavior in a clade of eight <i>Habronattus</i> spiders, which include 
<i>H. californicus</i> and <i>H. clypeatus</i>.  The later will be the 
next ontology to be posted.  This ontology was described at the 2002 
meetings of the American Arachnology Society, the Animal Behavior 
Society and at Measuring Behavior 2002.



<h1>Miscellaneous Introductory Material</h1>

<h2>How to read the HTML rendered ontologies</h2>

<p>The generated rendition of the ontology begins with an outline of the
concepts defined in the ontology, organized by superclass/subclass relations.&nbsp;
Within the page for each concept, there is a textual definition, followed
by a list of slots for that concept.&nbsp; Each slot specifies a relation
that may (or must) exist between instances of the current class and other
objects described in the ontology or its associated knowledge base.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each slot is specified by a name, a description, and several other 
properties (also called facets of the slot).&nbsp;
The "Type" property specifies the "data type" of the object that fills it
- usually instance, less frequently class or number.&nbsp; The "Allowed 
values" property specifies the classes that can fill a slot of "Type" instance.&nbsp;
This is a more "implementation transparent" notion of type.&nbsp; Finally,
the cardinality specifies the number of things that the slot can refer
to: the token <tt>0:*</tt> means the slot can refer to any number of things.</p>

<h1>
On-Going Projects and Future Work</h1>


<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Loggerhead Nesting</b> Although the coverage of the behavioral terms is 
complete, this ontology is useful as a test bed for developing software 
tools and advanced representation ideas, such as prototypes.  Prototypes 
are particularly important in published ontologies since the descriptions 
represent a summary of multiple events. 
</p></li>

<li>
<p>
<b><i>Habronattus courtship</i></b> I am working towards having <a href="http://ethotools.sourceforge.net/owlwatcher">OwlWatcher</a> in a state to reconstruct
the Habronattus ontologies, using OWL and aiming towards OBO-foundry compliance.  
</p> </li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Comparative Methods</b> The primary goal of the work described here is to
develop comparative methods for ontology-based behavior data.
I have discussed issues of alignment and comparative methods in several recent presentations, which are linked 
<a href="Presentations">here</a>. </p> </li>
