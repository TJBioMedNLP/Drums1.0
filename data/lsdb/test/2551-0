You can move to the supplementary data for Gloor, Martin, Wahl and Dunn (Biochemistry. 2005 May 17;44(19):7156-65) by clicking this <a href="//www.biochem.uwo.ca/cgi-bin/MI/index.cgi">link</a>.

<p>
This <a href="index.cgi?Table1">Table1</a> of the residues that share MI with only one other from the alignments that contain at least 125 sequences.
</p>


<p>
The <a href="index.cgi?MIvsH">MIvsH</a> page contains further information on the relationship between MI and entropy, as well as how different evolutionary models affect that relationship.
</p>


<p>
The <a href="index.cgi?ContactvsRank">ContactvsRank</a> page contains information about percentile scores of normalized MI
</p>


<p>
This site contains information on the alignments that contain &gt; 125 sequences. There are a a number of summary files, a picture of a representative structure associated with each entry, and a connection graph. The figures have the following format:
</p>


<ul>
<li>conserved residues in shades of blue, darkest blue is for most conserved, lightest blue is for least conserved (corresponds to an entropy of 0.3 (base20) or an information content of 3 bits). MI was not calculated for these residues.
<li>residues with MI scores &gt; 4 are shown in red if the both of the residues involved shares MI with only each other, in orange if the residue shares MI with a small number of others (&lt; 3), and in yellow if the residue shares MI with 3 or more others. 
<li>connection graphs are shown. The numbering inside the circle corresponds to the residue number in the pdb file. Numbering to the left of the connecting line corresponds the MI Z score (not the distance!)
