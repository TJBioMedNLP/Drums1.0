<p><b>Motivation:</b> Determining protein function is one of the most<sup>
</sup>important problems in the post-genomic era. For the typical<sup> </sup>proteome,
there are no functional annotations for one-third<sup> </sup>or more
of its proteins. Recent high-throughput experiments<sup> </sup>have
determined proteome-scale protein physical interaction<sup> </sup>maps
for several organisms. These physical interactions are<sup> </sup>complemented
by an abundance of data about other types of functional<sup> </sup>relationships
between proteins, including genetic interactions,<sup> </sup>knowledge
about co-expression and shared evolutionary history.<sup> </sup>Taken
together, these pairwise linkages can be used to build<sup> </sup>whole-proteome
protein interaction maps.<sup> </sup></p>
<b>Results:</b> We develop a network-flow based algorithm,
FunctionalFlow,<sup> </sup>that exploits the underlying structure of
protein interaction<sup> </sup>maps in order to predict protein
function. In cross-validation<sup> </sup>testing on the yeast
proteome, we show that FunctionalFlow has<sup> </sup>improved
performance over previous methods in predicting the<sup> </sup>function
of proteins with few (or no) annotated protein neighbors.<sup> </sup>By
comparing several methods that use protein interaction maps<sup> </sup>to
predict protein function, we demonstrate that FunctionalFlow<sup> </sup>performs
well because it takes advantage of both network topology<sup> </sup>and
some measure of locality. Finally, we show that performance<sup> </sup>can
be improved substantially as we consider multiple data sources<sup> </sup>and
use them to create weighted interaction networks.

<h2>Biological Process Predictions for Uncharacterized ORFs</h2>
We provide  confidence estimates for the best <span
 style="font-style: italic;">FunctionalFlow</span> prediction for each
ORF.&nbsp; The confidence values are obtained by
leave-one-out cross
validation.&nbsp; The scores were divided into 16 bins that contain
scores for roughly similar numbers of proteins.&nbsp; The fraction
of&nbsp; predictions in each bin that were made correctly is the
confidence value for all scores in the bin.  A curve was then fitted to the
bin scores, and it forms the basis of the confidence estimates for novel predictions.<br>
