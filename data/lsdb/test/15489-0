1. Download and Read the following function file on R. <p>
Download: <a href="SNEP.R">SNEP.R</a> <br>
Run: source("SNEP.R");
<p><hr></p>
You can know how to use SNEP by understanding Steps 2-6. If you want to directly analyze your CEL file, please read Step A given after Step 6. 
<p><hr></p>
2. Prepare two objects on R, <b>ProbeNamePair</b> and <b>Xdata</b>, e.g. from .CEL files.<p>
nprobe: Number of probes.<br>
nk: Number of replicates.<br>
<b>ProbeNamePair</b>: nprobe * 2 matrix. The first and second columns are "ProbeSetName" and "PairIndex" on a .CEL file. <br>
Example. <a href="ProbeNamePair.txt">ProbeNamePair.txt</a>. <br>
<b>Xdata</b>: nprobe * (2*nk) matrix. The rows correspond to the rows of ProbeNamePair. The first to nk-th columns correspond to one strain and the (nk+1)-th to (2*nk)-th columns correspond to the other strain. The elements are the log10 values of PM signal intensity. <br>
Example. <a href="Xdata.txt">Xdata.txt</a>.  <p>
You can make an example by running the following commands on R:<p>
ProbeNamePair = read.table("ProbeNamePair.txt", header=T); <br>
Xdata = read.table("Xdata.txt"); 
<p><hr></p>
3. Run the following commands on R to make global variables.<p>
nprobe = nrow(ProbeNamePair);<br>
ProbeNamePair$ID = 1:nprobe;<br>
ProbeFirstNum = subset(ProbeNamePair,PairIndex==1)$ID;<br>
npset = length(ProbeFirstNum);<br>
ProbeFirstNum = c(ProbeFirstNum,nprobe+1);<br>
<p><hr></p>
4. Run the following commands on R.<p>
##### Results<br>
wres = MulTestForGenes(Xdata,npset);<br>
pvalue = wres[1:nprobe]; <br>
tv.gene = wres[nprobe+1:npset];<br>
<p><hr></p>
5. Results.<p>
<b>pvalue</b>: nprobe * 1 vector with p-values for all the probes. <br>
The null hypothesis is that the probe is not an SFP and the alternative hypothesis is that the probe is <i>an SFP for the second strain</i>.<br>
pvalue=(p_1,...,p_npset), where p_a=(p_{a1},...,p_{aJ}), p_{aj} is the p-value for the j-th probe in the a-th probe set, J is the number of probes in the a-th probe set, typically 11. <br>
p-value for the alternative hypothesis that the probe is <i>an SFP for the first strain</i> : 1-pvalue<p>
<b>tv.gene</b>: npset * 1 vector with t-values based on the test statistic T0. <br>
The null hypothesis is that two expression levels for two strains are not different. <br>
tv.gene=(t_1,...,t_npset), where t_a is the t-value for the a-th gene. 
<p><hr></p>
6. Analysis of Example.<p>
You will obtain the following results after running the above R program for the example: ProbeNamePair.txt and Xdata.txt. 
<p>
> pvalue<br>
[1] 0.53554154 0.36027663 0.65617879 0.53554154 0.37713016 0.63959028 0.42898901 0.60564204 0.37713016 0.60564204 0.32739966 0.45266215 0.45266215 0.54828344 0.45266215 0.64117058 0.53239102 0.00000000 0.50047622 0.51644679 0.26124566 0.50047622 <br>
> tv.gene<br>
[1] 0.07209695 5.55782153 
</p>
When you need the p-value for the test statistic T0, you can calculate an approximate p-value by the following: <br>
> pv.gene = 2*(0.5-abs(0.5-pnorm(tv.gene))); pv.gene<br>
[1] 9.425247e-01 2.731625e-08
<p>
The example consists of two probe sets, which are illustrated in the following two graphs. 
The black and red correspond to the first and second strain with each 5 replicates, respectively. <br>
<IMG SRC="1.jpg" hspace="50"><IMG SRC="2.jpg"><p>
In the first figure, it seems that no SFP is present and two gene expression levels are almost the same. All of the p-values in the first probe set, pvalue[1:11], are not significant. The p-value for the difference of gene expression level between two strains, pv.gene[1], is not significant. <p>
In the second figure, it seems that the 7th probe is an SFP and two gene expression levels are different. The p-value on the 7th probe, pvalue[11+7]=0.00000000, shows highly significance. The p-value for the difference of gene expression level between two strains, pv.gene[2]=2.731625e-08, shows  highly significance.

A. Treatment of CEL file.<p>
You must install "Bioconductor" in advance. After that, please make "Xdata" and "ProbeNamePair" by following <a href="CELconvert.txt">this file</a>.
