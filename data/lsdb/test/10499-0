<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Motivation: </b>A post-translational modification (PTM) is a chemical
modification of a protein that occurs naturally. Many of these
modifications, such as phosphorylation, are known to play pivotal
roles in the regulation of protein function. Henceforth, PTM
perturbations have been linked to diverse diseases like Parkinson’s,
Alzheimer’s, diabetes and cancer. To discover PTMs on a genomewide
scale, there is a recent surge of interest in analyzing
tandem mass spectrometry data, and several unrestrictive (so-called
'blind') PTM search methods have been reported. However, these
approaches are subject to noise in mass measurements and in the
predicted modification site (amino acid position) within peptides,
which can result in false PTM assignments.

<p><b>Results: </b>To address these issues, we devised a machine learning
algorithm, PTMClust, that can be applied to the output of
blind PTM search methods to improve prediction quality, by
suppressing noise in the data and clustering peptides with the
same underlying modification to form PTM groups. We showed that
our technique outperforms two standard clustering algorithms on
a simulated dataset. Additionally, we showed that our algorithm
significantly improves sensitivity and specificity when applied to
the output of three different blind PTM search engines, SIMS,
InsPecT and MODmap.  Additionally, PTMClust markedly outforms another PTM refinement
algorithm, PTMFinder. We demonstrate that our technique is able to reduce false PTM
assignments, improve overall detection coverage and facilitate novel
PTM discovery, including terminus modifications. We applied our
technique to a large-scale yeast MS/MS proteome profiling dataset
and found numerous known and novel PTMs. Accurately identifying
modifications in protein sequences is a critical first step for PTM
profiling, and thus our approach may benefit routine proteomic
analysis.

<p><b>Availability and Implementation:</b> PTMClust is implemented in Matlab and is freely available for academic use.<br>
