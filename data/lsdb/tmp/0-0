      <h2><a name="fspma">A Friendly Statistics Toolbox for Microarray Analysis</a> </h2>
      <p>The friendly statistics toolbox for microarray analysis (FSPMA) is an
	R-library that is controlled by a definition file. FSPMA is available
	under the GPL 2 license. It is free software that comes with NO WARRANTY.
      </p>
      <h3> Functionality </h3>
      <p>
	FSPMA, <a href="#sykacek_etal_TR051">(Sykacek <i>et al</i>. 2005)</a>, is an R-library 
	that can be used to analyse microarray data. FSPMA's concept is to base microarray 
	analysis on a definition file that describes the experiment and which analysis steps should be done. 
	The definition file allows analysis without adapting or writing R-scripts. In addition it 
	serves as documantation of the analysis run. FSPMA can be used with data from different 
	platforms (single and two colour arrays) with optional preprocessing steps done before 
	the data gets loaded into FSPMA. The main restriction of FSPMA is that the experiment 
	must be a balanced reference design. Analysis includes handling of bad quality flagged 
	samples, conventional normalization and normalization with spike RNA, calculation of ANOVA 
	tables and variance components and finally gene ranking based on within ANOVA contrasts and 
	by using per gene ANOVA models. FSPMA is wrapped around YASMA, 
	<a href="#wernisch_etal_2003">(Wernisch <i>et al</i>. 2003)</a>, which it extends by 
	some preprocessing and normalization options and by more general contrasts that allow e.g. analysis 
	of longitudinal studies. To find out more about FSPMA's functionality, it is recommended to inspect 
	FSPMA's tutorial <a href="#sykacek_furlong_2005">(Sykacek & Furlong 2005)</a> which is part of 
	FSPMA's documentation files.
      </p>
      <h3> Installation </h3>
      <h4> R 2.1 under Windows 32 </h4>
      <p> 
      <ul>
	<li> If Perl is installed on the target machine, the easiest way to install FSPMA for R 
	  ver. 2.1 under Windows is to download the binary distribution 
	  <a href="srcfiles/fspmawin.zip">fspmawin.zip</a>, unzip the file in a local 
	  directory and run the batch file "fspmawininstall.bat".</li> 
	<li> Without Perl, an alternative method is to unzip the file and install both 
	  libraries from within the R-GUI for Windows. 
	  This is done by startng R 2.1 and selecting the option "Install package(s) from 
	  local zip files..." from the "Packages" menu and by selecting the folder that contains 
	  the unziped "fspmawin.zip" archive. The order is important: first install YASMA by 
	  selecting "yasma_0.20.zip", then install FSPMA by selecting "fspma_1.0.zip". 
	</li>
	<li>
	  Without Perl, the same is achieved by unziping the archive and sourcing 
	  "fspmawininstall.r" from within an R 2.1 session. The latter requires to make the 
	  folder that contains the library files to be the current directory. To do that 
	  one selects "Change dir..." from the "File" menu. Then 
	  choose "Source R code...", again found in the "File" menu and select "fspmawininstall.r". 
	  Sourcing should not require changing folders, otherwise something went wrong in the 
	  previous step and installation will fail because R can not allocate the library files. 
	</li>
      </ul>
      Either approach will install FSPMA and a slightly modified version of the 
      <a href="http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/wernisch/yasma.html" target="_blank">YASMA</a> library, 
      <a href="#wernisch_etal_2003">(Wernisch <i>et al</i>. 2003)</a>, on which FSPMA depends. Some 
      minor modifications of the original YASMA library were necessary for compatibility with R ver. 2.1
      and with the R Win32 tools, which do not support drand48() random number generation. Instead the 
      Win32 port uses R's internal uniform random number generator.
    </p>
      <h4> R 2.1 and other operating systems </h4>
      <p> For all other operating systems, one has to download the source distribution 
	<a href="srcfiles/fspmax.zip">fspmax.zip</a>. After unziping the file, 
	running the command "fspmaxinstall.sh" will install FSPMA and a modified version of the
	<a href="http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/wernisch/yasma.html" target="_blank">YASMA</a> library, 
	<a href="#wernisch_etal_2003">(Wernisch <i>et al</i>. 2003)</a>. Note that the source 
	distribution of the library has been tested with Linux (and Windows) only.
      </p>
      <h3> Testing the installation and learning about FSPMA</h3>
      <p> 
	To test the installation, one should use the examples provided in FSPMA's online help.
	See the package overview for details. There are five zip archives containing definition 
	files and the corresponding data files. These examples are meant for evaluation purpouse and 
	contain a small number of genes of a larger study done by R. Furlong of the Dept. of Pathology, 
	University of Cambridge. The run time of each example is thus rather small. Downloading and extracting
	fspma-tutorial.zip from the package overview page in FSPMA's online help, one can
	obtain the "fspma.Rnw" Sweave file (see the R help on how to use Sweave) 
	which together with the experiments will generate the LaTex sources of the FSPMA tutorial 
	<a href="#sykacek_furlong_2005">(Sykacek & Furlong 2005)</a>. This step will run all code 
	fragments in the tutorial and requires that all experimental data and the Sweave file to reside 
	<i>unziped</i> in the same directory. Individual experiments can be run by downloading and 
	extracting the relevant archive into a local directory. Analysis is started by invoking 
	"fspma.wrapper" on the R command line using the name of the definition file as parameter, exactly
	as is shown in the tutorial. Refer to <a href="#sykacek_furlong_2005">(Sykacek & Furlong 2005)</a> for 
	further details on the output of such analysis runs and how to produce different visualisations of the 
	data and the analysis results.
      </p>
      <h3> A real world dataset </h3>
      <p>
	We provide here an additional documented <a href="srcfiles/tstsgd_A.def.gz">definition file</a>
	for a public Affymetrix dataset. This file must be unzipped (e.g. gunzip)
	and stored in a directory of your choice. The microarray data that will be analysed by this file 
	have been published as <a href="#small_etal_2005" >(Small <i> et al </i>. 2005)</a> and 
	can be downloaded form the 
	<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&DB=gds"  
	  target="_blank">NCBI GEO Datasets server</a> under reference GDS660. These data files must be
	stored in the same directory as the definition file. Subsequently one has to start R in that directory 
	and type the following commands at the command line. Different to the examples provided with the library, 
	this definition file provides an analysis of realistic size. In particular evaluating base level 
	comparisons which are shortcuts for several pair wise comparisons and k nearest beighbour imputation can 
	be computationally quite demanding. The definition file of this example is discussed in 
	<a href="#sykacek_TR051">(Sykacek 2005)</a> which is also part of FSPMA's online help.
      </p>
      <table width="100%" frame="none">
	<tbody>
	  <tr>
	    <td>>>library(fspma)</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>>>ret <- fspma.wrapper('tstsgd_A.def')</td>
	  </tr>
	</tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
	As soon as the script terminates, there will be several additional files in that directory. These files
	contain the normalized raw data and a corresponding effects description, a file with an ANOVA table
	and variance components (although the latter will not show up in this analysis, since there is only 
	one random effect which is captured by the residual noise) and several files that contain 
	the rank lists that correspond to different tests.
      </p>
      <h3> Further Information </h3>
      <p> FSPMA comes with extensive documentation. There are two tutorial like technical reports, one 
	provides an overview and the second a detailed discussion of definition files. In addition all 
	user level functions of FSPMA are described in detail in the online help.
