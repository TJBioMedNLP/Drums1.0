  LAMP is a method for the inference of locus-specific ancestry in recently admixed populations. 
The description of the original algorithm and an evaluation of the program can be found at: 
<ul>
<li>Sriram Sankararaman, Srinath Sridhar, Gad Kimmel and Eran
Halperin, <i> Estimating Local Ancestry in Admixed Populations, </i>
The American Journal of Human Genetics, Volume
82, Issue 2, 290-303, 2008.</li>
</ul>
The new version of the program (lamp-2.3) uses an improved modeling of
the recombinations events, leading to a better accuracy for recently
admixed populations where the ancestral populations are closely
related (e.g., European Americans or Japanese-Chinese, etc.), in case
the ancestral populations are known. These improvements are described
in the paper:

 For citation purposes, we ask that you please cite Sankararaman et
  al if you use the unsupervised version of the method (i.e., the
ancestral populations are not known), and please cite Pasaniuc et al.,
2009 if you use the supervised version where the ancestral populations
are known.
