						<!--<h2>About CHS</h2>-->
						The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is an NHLBI-funded observational study of 
						risk factors for cardiovascular disease in adults 65 years or older. Starting 
						in 1989, and continuing through 1999, participants underwent annual extensive 
						clinical examinations. Measurements included traditional risk factors such as 
						blood pressure and lipids as well as measures of subclinical disease, including 
						echocardiography of the heart, carotid ultrasound, and cranial 
						magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI). At six month intervals between clinic visits, 
						and once clinic visits ended, participants were contacted by phone to ascertain 
						hospitalizations and health status. The main outcomes are coronary heart 
						disease (CHD), angina, heart failure (HF), stroke, transient ischemic attack 
						(TIA), claudication, and mortality. Participants continue to be followed for 
						these events. To date, more than 400 research papers from CHS have been 
						published and more than 120 ancillary studies are ongoing or complete. <a href="CHSOverview.htm">
