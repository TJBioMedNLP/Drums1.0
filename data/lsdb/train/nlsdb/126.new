<h2>Artefacts and biases affecting the evaluation of scoring function on decoy sets for protein structure prediction</h2>
<h4>Julia Handl, Joshua Knowles and Simon C. Lovell</h4>


<p align="justify">
Decoy data sets, consisting of a solved protein structure and numerous
alternative native-like structures, are in common use for both the 
evaluation and the development of scoring functions in 
protein structure prediction. Several pitfalls with the use of these data sets have been 
identified in the literature, as well as useful guidelines for generating more
effective decoy data sets. We contribute to this ongoing discussion
an empirical assessment of several decoy data sets commonly used in experimental
studies.
We find that artefacts in the large majority of these
data make it trivial to discriminate the native structure, and even
the use of several decoy sets does not insure against this. More
fundamentally, sampling biases present in the way these data are
generated or used can strongly affect measurement of the correlation
between score and RMSD to the native. We demonstrate how, depending on
type of bias and evaluation context, sampling biases may lead to both
over- or under-estimation of the quality of scoring terms, functions 
or methods.
