<h1  >Welcome!</h1><p  ><strong>Human-Computer Interaction</strong> (HCI) is the region of intersection between the social and behavioral sciences, and information technology. It provides a challenging test domain for applying and developing social theory and a stringent source of constraint for creating and evaluating new information systems.</p><p  >The CS department has created an outstanding faculty in human-computer interaction. A successful "research infrastructure" (RI) award from NSF in the mid-1990s allowed the construction of specialized laboratories for HCI research. The department's commitment to this endeavor was reflected in faculty hiring so that he HCI group now consists of eight core faculty and twelve other affiliated faculty, research scientists, emeritus faculty, or research faculty. Laboratory facilities for conducting HCI research are contained in the Center for Human-Computer Interaction located in Torgersen Hall and two shared laboratories located in McBryde Hall. The HCI group has found good synergy in the "gigapixel display" project that has received initial funding from NSF. The HCI group is also the point of contact between the department and the arts and humanities. The department is collaborating on a "cyberarts" program in conjunction with departments in the College of Architecture and the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences.</p><h2  >Recent news</h2><p><strong>Supporting participant costs of grad student research</strong> <font color='gray'>(2010-02-19)</font><br>Graduate Students: If you seek support for the costs of participants in your research, please submit a research proposal as follows:
a) Describe the background and plan for the study;
b) explain why you need paid participants in your study; 
c) Include the IRB request;
d) Specify which faculty you are working with on the research. 
e) Address whether the research falls under a funded project, and if so, please explain why funding cannot come from the funded project.

Building "places of our own" for personal information.</p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br><p>Our tools and technologies of Web access and mobile gadgetry work increasingly to remove physical place as a factor of concern in the access to digital information. But research continues to point to an importance of digital "place" and "placing" in the management of personal information. How can we build places of our own for digital information while still taking advantage of a wealth of tools and services for information storage and management? For tool developers, how to innovate without forcing people to re-organize or re-locate their information?</p>
<p>The talk will describe initial work in support of a personal unifying taxonomy (PUT) that might provide the means to label (or locate) all information that matters to its owner. The PUT is journaling of the past, planning of the future and living in a present increasingly dominated by digital information. A PUT affords its owner fast, "anywhere" access to personal information. A PUT affords tool-makers a means for non-disruptive innovation.  Work on the PUT is an outgrowth of prototyping work in the Keeping Found Things Found (KFTF) project on an XML-based architecture in which large, integrative views are constructed from a dynamic, on-demand assembly of XML fragments.</p>
<p>The talk will include demonstrations of three distinct tools (supporting very different modes of information management) applied to the same structure. Time permitting, the talk will also review motivating KFTF data collected from fieldwork interviews and prototype evaluations.</p>
</p><p><strong>Bio:</strong><br>William Jones is a Research Associate Professor in the Information School at the University of Washington where he manages the Keeping Found Things Found group (<a href="http://kftf.ischool.washington.edu"> http://kftf.ischool.washington.edu</a>). He has published in the areas of personal information management (PIM), human-computer interaction, information retrieval and cognitive psychology. Prof. Jones wrote the book "Keeping Found Things Found: The Study and Practice of Personal Information Management" and also edited the book "Personal Information Management" (with co-editor Jaime Teevan). Prof. Jones received his doctorate from Carnegie-Mellon University for research into human memory.</p><p><a href='seminars.php'>More seminars</a>...</p><br><p><img src="images/chci.png" alt="CHCI Logo" width="200" height="77"  ></p>
